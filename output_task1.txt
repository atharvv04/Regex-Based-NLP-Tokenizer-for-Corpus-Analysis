Text = A SENTIMENTAL STORY FROM THE DIARY OF A DREAMER
</Sent>
<Sent id="39">
Text = FIRST NIGHT
</Sent>
<Sent id="40">
Text = It was a wonderful night, such a night as is only possible when we are
young, dear reader.
</Sent>
<Sent id="41">
Text = The sky was so starry, so bright that, looking at
it, one could not help asking oneself whether ill-humoured and
capricious people could live under such a sky.
</Sent>
<Sent id="42">
Text = That is a youthful
question too, dear reader, very youthful, but may the Lord put it more
frequently into your heart!...
</Sent>
<Sent id="43">
Text = Speaking of capricious and ill-humoured
people, I cannot help recalling my moral condition all that day.
</Sent>
<Sent id="44">
Text = From
early morning I had been oppressed by a strange despondency.
</Sent>
<Sent id="45">
Text = It suddenly
seemed to me that I was lonely, that every one was forsaking me and
going away from me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="46">
Text = Of course, any one is entitled to ask who "every
one" was.
</Sent>
<Sent id="47">
Text = For though I had been living almost eight years in Petersburg
I had hardly an acquaintance.
</Sent>
<Sent id="48">
Text = But what did I want with acquaintances?
</Sent>
<Sent id="49">
Text = I
was acquainted with all Petersburg as it was; that was why I felt as
though they were all deserting me when all Petersburg packed up and went
to its summer villa.
</Sent>
<Sent id="50">
Text = I felt afraid of being left alone, and for three
whole days I wandered about the town in profound dejection, not knowing
what to do with myself.
</Sent>
<Sent id="51">
Text = Whether I walked in the Nevsky, went to the
Gardens or sauntered on the embankment, there was not one face of those
I had been accustomed to meet at the same time and place all the year.
</Sent>
<Sent id="52">
Text = They, of course, do not know me, but I know them.
</Sent>
<Sent id="53">
Text = I know them
intimately, I have almost made a study of their faces, and am delighted
when they are gay, and downcast when they are under a cloud.
</Sent>
<Sent id="54">
Text = I have
almost struck up a friendship with one old man whom I meet every blessed
day, at the same hour in Fontanka.
</Sent>
<Sent id="55">
Text = Such a grave, pensive countenance; he
is always whispering to himself and brandishing his left arm, while in
his right hand he holds a long gnarled stick with a gold knob.
</Sent>
<Sent id="56">
Text = He even
notices me and takes a warm interest in me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="57">
Text = If I happen not to be at a
certain time in the same spot in Fontanka, I am certain he feels
disappointed.
</Sent>
<Sent id="58">
Text = That is how it is that we almost bow to each other,
especially when we are both in good humour.
</Sent>
<Sent id="59">
Text = The other day, when we had
not seen each other for two days and met on the third, we were actually
touching our hats, but, realizing in time, dropped our hands and passed
each other with a look of interest.
</Sent>
<Sent id="60">
Text = I know the houses too.
</Sent>
<Sent id="61">
Text = As I walk along they seem to run forward in the
streets to look out at me from every window, and almost to say:
"Good-morning!
</Sent>
<Sent id="62">
Text = How do you do?
</Sent>
<Sent id="63">
Text = I am quite well, thank God, and I am to
have a new storey in May," or, "How are you?
</Sent>
<Sent id="64">
Text = I am being redecorated
to-morrow;" or, "I was almost burnt down and had such a fright," and so
on.
</Sent>
<Sent id="65">
Text = I have my favourites among them, some are dear friends; one of them
intends to be treated by the architect this summer.
</Sent>
<Sent id="66">
Text = I shall go every day
on purpose to see that the operation is not a failure.
</Sent>
<Sent id="67">
Text = God forbid!
</Sent>
<Sent id="68">
Text = But I
shall never forget an incident with a very pretty little house of a
light pink colour.
</Sent>
<Sent id="69">
Text = It was such a charming little brick house, it looked
so hospitably at me, and so proudly at its ungainly neighbours, that my
heart rejoiced whenever I happened to pass it.
</Sent>
<Sent id="70">
Text = Suddenly last week I
walked along the street, and when I looked at my friend I heard a
plaintive, "They are painting me yellow!" The villains!
</Sent>
<Sent id="71">
Text = The barbarians!
</Sent>
<Sent id="72">
Text = They had spared nothing, neither columns, nor cornices, and my poor
little friend was as yellow as a canary.
</Sent>
<Sent id="73">
Text = It almost made me bilious.
</Sent>
<Sent id="74">
Text = And
to this day I have not had the courage to visit my poor disfigured
friend, painted the colour of the Celestial Empire.
</Sent>
<Sent id="75">
Text = So now you understand, reader, in what sense I am acquainted with all
Petersburg.
</Sent>
<Sent id="76">
Text = I have mentioned already that I had felt worried for three whole days
before I guessed the cause of my uneasiness.
</Sent>
<Sent id="77">
Text = And I felt ill at ease in
the street--this one had gone and that one had gone, and what had become
of the other?--and at home I did not feel like myself either.
</Sent>
<Sent id="78">
Text = For two
evenings I was puzzling my brains to think what was amiss in my corner;
why I felt so uncomfortable in it.
</Sent>
<Sent id="79">
Text = And in perplexity I scanned my grimy
green walls, my ceiling covered with a spider's web, the growth of which
Matrona has so successfully encouraged.
</Sent>
<Sent id="80">
Text = I looked over all my furniture,
examined every chair, wondering whether the trouble lay there (for if
one chair is not standing in the same position as it stood the day
before, I am not myself).
</Sent>
<Sent id="81">
Text = I looked at the window, but it was all in vain
...
</Sent>
<Sent id="82">
Text = I was not a bit the better for it!
</Sent>
<Sent id="83">
Text = I even bethought me to send for
Matrona, and was giving her some fatherly admonitions in regard to the
spider's web and sluttishness in general; but she simply stared at me in
amazement and went away without saying a word, so that the spider's web
is comfortably hanging in its place to this day.
</Sent>
<Sent id="84">
Text = I only at last this
morning realized what was wrong.
</Sent>
<Sent id="85">
Text = Aie!
</Sent>
<Sent id="86">
Text = Why, they are giving me the slip
and making off to their summer villas!
</Sent>
<Sent id="87">
Text = Forgive the triviality of the
expression, but I am in no mood for fine language ... for everything
that had been in Petersburg had gone or was going away for the holidays;
for every respectable gentleman of dignified appearance who took a cab
was at once transformed, in my eyes, into a respectable head of a
household who after his daily duties were over, was making his way to
the bosom of his family, to the summer villa; for all the passers-by had
now quite a peculiar air which seemed to say to every one they met: "We
are only here for the moment, gentlemen, and in another two hours we
shall be going off to the summer villa." If a window opened after
delicate fingers, white as snow, had tapped upon the pane, and the head
of a pretty girl was thrust out, calling to a street-seller with pots of
flowers--at once on the spot I fancied that those flowers were being
bought not simply in order to enjoy the flowers and the spring in stuffy
town lodgings, but because they would all be very soon moving into the
country and could take the flowers with them.
</Sent>
<Sent id="88">
Text = What is more, I made such
progress in my new peculiar sort of investigation that I could
distinguish correctly from the mere air of each in what summer villa he
was living.
</Sent>
<Sent id="89">
Text = The inhabitants of Kamenny and Aptekarsky Islands or of the
Peterhof Road were marked by the studied elegance of their manner, their
fashionable summer suits, and the fine carriages in which they drove to
town.
</Sent>
<Sent id="90">
Text = Visitors to Pargolovo and places further away impressed one at
first sight by their reasonable and dignified air; the tripper to
Krestovsky Island could be recognized by his look of irrepressible
gaiety.
</Sent>
<Sent id="91">
Text = If I chanced to meet a long procession of waggoners walking
lazily with the reins in their hands beside waggons loaded with regular
mountains of furniture, tables, chairs, ottomans and sofas and domestic
utensils of all sorts, frequently with a decrepit cook sitting on the
top of it all, guarding her master's property as though it were the
apple of her eye; or if I saw boats heavily loaded with household goods
crawling along the Neva or Fontanka to the Black River or the
Islands--the waggons and the boats were multiplied tenfold, a
hundredfold, in my eyes.
</Sent>
<Sent id="92">
Text = I fancied that everything was astir and moving,
everything was going in regular caravans to the summer villas.
</Sent>
<Sent id="93">
Text = It seemed
as though Petersburg threatened to become a wilderness, so that at last
I felt ashamed, mortified and sad that I had nowhere to go for the
holidays and no reason to go away.
</Sent>
<Sent id="94">
Text = I was ready to go away with every
waggon, to drive off with every gentleman of respectable appearance who
took a cab; but no one--absolutely no one--invited me; it seemed they
had forgotten me, as though really I were a stranger to them!
</Sent>
<Sent id="95">
Text = I took long walks, succeeding, as I usually did, in quite forgetting
where I was, when I suddenly found myself at the city gates.
</Sent>
<Sent id="96">
Text = Instantly I
felt lighthearted, and I passed the barrier and walked between
cultivated fields and meadows, unconscious of fatigue, and feeling only
all over as though a burden were falling off my soul.
</Sent>
<Sent id="97">
Text = All the passers-by
gave me such friendly looks that they seemed almost greeting me, they
all seemed so pleased at something.
</Sent>
<Sent id="98">
Text = They were all smoking cigars, every
one of them.
</Sent>
<Sent id="99">
Text = And I felt pleased as I never had before.
</Sent>
<Sent id="100">
Text = It was as though
I had suddenly found myself in Italy--so strong was the effect of nature
upon a half-sick townsman like me, almost stifling between city walls.
</Sent>
<Sent id="101">
Text = There is something inexpressibly touching in nature round Petersburg,
when at the approach of spring she puts forth all her might, all the
powers bestowed on her by Heaven, when she breaks into leaf, decks
herself out and spangles herself with flowers....
</Sent>
<Sent id="102">
Text = Somehow I cannot help
being reminded of a frail, consumptive girl, at whom one sometimes looks
with compassion, sometimes with sympathetic love, whom sometimes one
simply does not notice; though suddenly in one instant she becomes, as
though by chance, inexplicably lovely and exquisite, and, impressed and
intoxicated, one cannot help asking oneself what power made those sad,
pensive eyes flash with such fire?
</Sent>
<Sent id="103">
Text = What summoned the blood to those
pale, wan cheeks?
</Sent>
<Sent id="104">
Text = What bathed with passion those soft features?
</Sent>
<Sent id="105">
Text = What set
that bosom heaving?
</Sent>
<Sent id="106">
Text = What so suddenly called strength, life and beauty
into the poor girl's face, making it gleam with such a smile, kindle
with such bright, sparkling laughter?
</Sent>
<Sent id="107">
Text = You look round, you seek for some
one, you conjecture....
</Sent>
<Sent id="108">
Text = But the moment passes, and next day you meet,
maybe, the same pensive and preoccupied look as before, the same pale
face, the same meek and timid movements, and even signs of remorse,
traces of a mortal anguish and regret for the fleeting distraction....
</Sent>
<Sent id="109">
Text = And you grieve that the momentary beauty has faded so soon never to
return, that it flashed upon you so treacherously, so vainly, grieve
because you had not even time to love her....
</Sent>
<Sent id="110">
Text = And yet my night was better than my day!
</Sent>
<Sent id="111">
Text = This was how it happened.
</Sent>
<Sent id="112">
Text = I came back to the town very late, and it had struck ten as I was going
towards my lodgings.
</Sent>
<Sent id="113">
Text = My way lay along the canal embankment, where at
that hour you never meet a soul.
</Sent>
<Sent id="114">
Text = It is true that I live in a very remote
part of the town.
</Sent>
<Sent id="115">
Text = I walked along singing, for when I am happy I am
always humming to myself like every happy man who has no friend or
acquaintance with whom to share his joy.
</Sent>
<Sent id="116">
Text = Suddenly I had a most
unexpected adventure.
</Sent>
<Sent id="117">
Text = Leaning on the canal railing stood a woman with her elbows on the rail,
she was apparently looking with great attention at the muddy water of
the canal.
</Sent>
<Sent id="118">
Text = She was wearing a very charming yellow hat and a jaunty
little black mantle. "She's a girl, and I am sure she is dark," I
thought.
</Sent>
<Sent id="119">
Text = She did not seem to hear my footsteps, and did not even stir
when I passed by with bated breath and loudly throbbing heart.

"Strange," I thought; "she must be deeply absorbed in something," and
all at once I stopped as though petrified.
</Sent>
<Sent id="120">
Text = I heard a muffled sob.
</Sent>
<Sent id="121">
Text = Yes!
</Sent>
<Sent id="122">
Text = I
was not mistaken, the girl was crying, and a minute later I heard sob
after sob.
</Sent>
<Sent id="123">
Text = Good Heavens!
</Sent>
<Sent id="124">
Text = My heart sank.
</Sent>
<Sent id="125">
Text = And timid as I was with women,
yet this was such a moment!...
</Sent>
<Sent id="126">
Text = I turned, took a step towards her, and
should certainly have pronounced the word "Madam!" if I had not known
that that exclamation has been uttered a thousand times in every Russian
society novel.
</Sent>
<Sent id="127">
Text = It was only that reflection stopped me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="128">
Text = But while I was
seeking for a word, the girl came to herself, looked round, started,
cast down her eyes and slipped by me along the embankment.
</Sent>
<Sent id="129">
Text = I at once
followed her; but she, divining this, left the embankment, crossed the
road and walked along the pavement.
</Sent>
<Sent id="130">
Text = I dared not cross the street after
her.
</Sent>
<Sent id="131">
Text = My heart was fluttering like a captured bird.
</Sent>
<Sent id="132">
Text = All at once a chance
came to my aid.
</Sent>
<Sent id="133">
Text = Along the same side of the pavement there suddenly came into sight, not
far from the girl, a gentleman in evening dress, of dignified years,
though by no means of dignified carriage; he was staggering and
cautiously leaning against the wall.
</Sent>
<Sent id="134">
Text = The girl flew straight as an arrow,
with the timid haste one sees in all girls who do not want any one to
volunteer to accompany them home at night, and no doubt the staggering
gentleman would not have pursued her, if my good luck had not prompted
him.
</Sent>
<Sent id="135">
Text = Suddenly, without a word to any one, the gentleman set off and flew full
speed in pursuit of my unknown lady.
</Sent>
<Sent id="136">
Text = She was racing like the wind, but
the staggering gentleman was overtaking--overtook her.
</Sent>
<Sent id="137">
Text = The girl uttered
a shriek, and ...
</Sent>
<Sent id="138">
Text = I bless my luck for the excellent knotted stick, which
happened on that occasion to be in my right hand.
</Sent>
<Sent id="139">
Text = In a flash I was on
the other side of the street; in a flash the obtrusive gentleman had
taken in the position, had grasped the irresistible argument, fallen
back without a word, and only when we were very far away protested
against my action in rather vigorous language.
</Sent>
<Sent id="140">
Text = But his words hardly
reached us.

"Give me your arm," I said to the girl. "And he won't dare to annoy us
further."
</Sent>
<Sent id="141">
Text = She took my arm without a word, still trembling with excitement and
terror.
</Sent>
<Sent id="142">
Text = Oh, obtrusive gentleman!
</Sent>
<Sent id="143">
Text = How I blessed you at that moment!
</Sent>
<Sent id="144">
Text = I
stole a glance at her, she was very charming and dark--I had guessed
right.
</Sent>
<Sent id="145">
Text = On her black eyelashes there still glistened a tear--from her recent
terror or her former grief--I don't know.
</Sent>
<Sent id="146">
Text = But there was already a gleam
of a smile on her lips.
</Sent>
<Sent id="147">
Text = She too stole a glance at me, faintly blushed
and looked down.

"There, you see; why did you drive me away?
</Sent>
<Sent id="148">
Text = If I had been here, nothing
would have happened...."

"But I did not know you;
</Sent>
<Sent id="149">
Text = I thought that you too...."

"Why, do you know me now?"

"A little!
</Sent>
<Sent id="150">
Text = Here, for instance, why are you trembling?"

"Oh, you are right at the first guess!" I answered, delighted that my
girl had intelligence; that is never out of place in company with
beauty. "Yes, from the first glance you have guessed the sort of man you
have to do with.
</Sent>
<Sent id="151">
Text = Precisely;
</Sent>
<Sent id="152">
Text = I am shy with women, I am agitated, I don't
deny it, as much so as you were a minute ago when that gentleman alarmed
you.
</Sent>
<Sent id="153">
Text = I am in some alarm now.
</Sent>
<Sent id="154">
Text = It's like a dream, and I never guessed even
in my sleep that I should ever talk with any woman."

"What?
</Sent>
<Sent id="155">
Text = Really?..."

"Yes; if my arm trembles, it is because it has never been held by a
pretty little hand like yours.
</Sent>
<Sent id="156">
Text = I am a complete stranger to women; that
is, I have never been used to them.
</Sent>
<Sent id="157">
Text = You see, I am alone....
</Sent>
<Sent id="158">
Text = I don't even
know how to talk to them.
</Sent>
<Sent id="159">
Text = Here, I don't know now whether I have not said
something silly to you!
</Sent>
<Sent id="160">
Text = Tell me frankly;
</Sent>
<Sent id="161">
Text = I assure you beforehand that I
am not quick to take offence?..."

"No, nothing, nothing, quite the contrary.
</Sent>
<Sent id="162">
Text = And if you insist on my
speaking frankly, I will tell you that women like such timidity; and if
you want to know more, I like it too, and I won't drive you away till I
get home."

"You will make me," I said, breathless with delight, "lose my timidity,
and then farewell to all my chances...."

"Chances!
</Sent>
<Sent id="163">
Text = What chances--of what?
</Sent>
<Sent id="164">
Text = That's not so nice."

"I beg your pardon, I am sorry, it was a slip of the tongue; but how can
you expect one at such a moment to have no desire...."

"To be liked, eh?"

"Well, yes; but do, for goodness' sake, be kind.
</Sent>
<Sent id="165">
Text = Think what I am!
</Sent>
<Sent id="166">
Text = Here,
I am twenty-six and I have never seen any one.
</Sent>
<Sent id="167">
Text = How can I speak well,
tactfully, and to the point?
</Sent>
<Sent id="168">
Text = It will seem better to you when I have told
you everything openly....
</Sent>
<Sent id="169">
Text = I don't know how to be silent when my heart is
speaking.
</Sent>
<Sent id="170">
Text = Well, never mind....
</Sent>
<Sent id="171">
Text = Believe me, not one woman, never, never!
</Sent>
<Sent id="172">
Text = No acquaintance of any sort!
</Sent>
<Sent id="173">
Text = And I do nothing but dream every day that
at last I shall meet some one.
</Sent>
<Sent id="174">
Text = Oh, if only you knew how often I have
been in love in that way...."

"How?
</Sent>
<Sent id="175">
Text = With whom?..."

"Why, with no one, with an ideal, with the one I dream of in my sleep.
</Sent>
<Sent id="176">
Text = I
make up regular romances in my dreams.
</Sent>
<Sent id="177">
Text = Ah, you don't know me!
</Sent>
<Sent id="178">
Text = It's true,
of course, I have met two or three women, but what sort of women were
they?
</Sent>
<Sent id="179">
Text = They were all landladies, that....
</Sent>
<Sent id="180">
Text = But I shall make you laugh if I
tell you that I have several times thought of speaking, just simply
speaking, to some aristocratic lady in the street, when she is alone, I
need hardly say; speaking to her, of course, timidly, respectfully,
passionately; telling her that I am perishing in solitude, begging her
not to send me away; saying that I have no chance of making the
acquaintance of any woman; impressing upon her that it is a positive
duty for a woman not to repulse so timid a prayer from such a luckless
man as me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="181">
Text = That, in fact, all I ask is, that she should say two or three
sisterly words with sympathy, should not repulse me at first sight;
should take me on trust and listen to what I say; should laugh at me if
she likes, encourage me, say two words to me, only two words, even
though we never meet again afterwards!...
</Sent>
<Sent id="182">
Text = But you are laughing; however,

pranks two years ago, and she saw there was no holding me in, she called
me up and pinned my dress to hers, and ever since we sit like that for
days together; she knits a stocking, though she's blind, and I sit
beside her, sew or read aloud to her--it's such a queer habit, here for
two years I've been pinned to her...."

began as though reading from a manuscript:--

"There are, Nastenka, though you may not know it, strange nooks in
Petersburg.

people does not peep into those spots, but some other different new one,
bespoken expressly for those nooks, and it throws a different light on
everything.

Text = In these corners, dear Nastenka, quite a different life is
lived, quite unlike the life that is surging round us, but such as
perhaps exists in some unknown realm, not among us in our serious,
over-serious, time.

<Sent id="314">
Text = Well, that life is a mixture of something purely
fantastic, fervently ideal, with something (alas!

prosaic and ordinary, not to say incredibly vulgar."

"Foo!

acquaintances (and he ends by getting rid of all his friends), why does
this absurd person meet him with such embarrassment, changing
countenance and overcome with confusion, as though he had only just
committed some crime within his four walls; as though he had been
forging counterfeit notes, or as though he were writing verses to be
sent to a journal with an anonymous letter, in which he states that the
real poet is dead, and that his friend thinks it his sacred duty to
publish his things?

fair sex, and other cheerful subjects?

probably a new friend and on his first visit--for there will hardly be a
second, and the friend will never come again--why is the friend himself
so confused, so tongue-tied, in spite of his wit (if he has any), as he
looks at the downcast face of his host, who in his turn becomes utterly
helpless and at his wits' end after gigantic but fruitless efforts to
smooth things over and enliven the conversation, to show his knowledge
of polite society, to talk, too, of the fair sex, and by such humble
endeavour, to please the poor man, who like a fish out of water has
mistakenly come to visit him?

<Sent id="327">

remembering some very necessary business which never existed, suddenly
seize his hat and hurriedly make off, snatching away his hand from the
warm grip of his host, who was trying his utmost to show his regret and
retrieve the lost position?

<Sent id="328">
Text = Why does the friend chuckle as he goes out
of the door, and swear never to come and see this queer creature again,
though the queer creature is really a very good fellow, and at the same
time he cannot refuse his imagination the little diversion of comparing
the queer fellow's countenance during their conversation with the
expression of an unhappy kitten treacherously captured, roughly handled,
frightened and subjected to all sorts of indignities by children, till,
utterly crestfallen, it hides away from them under a chair in the dark,
and there must needs at its leisure bristle up, spit, and wash its
insulted face with both paws, and long afterwards look angrily at life
and nature, and even at the bits saved from the master's dinner for it
by the sympathetic housekeeper?"

"Listen," interrupted Nastenka, who had listened to me all the time in
amazement, opening her eyes and her little mouth. "Listen;

"Doubtless," I answered, with the gravest face.

"Well, since there is no doubt about it, go on," said Nastenka, "because
I want very much to know how it will end."

"You want to know, Nastenka, what our hero, that is I--for the hero of
the whole business was my humble self--did in his corner?

virtuous girls; how, on the excuse that they want to marry them, they
carry them off from their parents' houses; how afterwards they leave
these unhappy girls to their fate, and they perish in the most pitiful
way.

almost half.

had acquaintances, and suddenly said: 'I have taken a box at the opera

Rosina myself in old days, at a private performance!'

but all that evening our lodger looked at me so nicely, talked so
nicely, that I saw at once that he had meant to test me in the morning

season was over, and our lodger had quite given up coming to see us;

so silently, so gravely, as though he did not want to speak, and go down
to the front door, while I went on standing in the middle of the stairs,
as red as a cherry, for all the blood rushed to my head at the sight of
him.

liked, because I could not live without him.

screwing up all her courage. "There's no sign or sound of him."

up from the seat in utter despair. "Tell me, Nastenka, wouldn't it be
possible for me to go to him?"

"Would that be possible?" she asked suddenly, raising her head.

"No, of course not," I said pulling myself up; "but I tell you what,
write a letter."

"No, that's impossible, I can't do that," she answered with decision,
bending her head and not looking at me.

"How impossible--why is it impossible?" I went on, clinging to my idea.

that he behaved very well," I went on, more and more carried away by the
logic of my own arguments and convictions. "How did he behave?

himself by a promise: he said that if he married at all he would marry
no one but you; he gave you full liberty to refuse him at once....

"Oh dear!" she answered; "if I were less happy, I believe I should cry
at your lack of faith, at your reproaches.

that's enough about feelings...."

Text = At that moment we heard footsteps, and in the darkness we saw a figure
coming towards us.
</Sent>
<Sent id="642">
Text = We both started; she almost cried out;

Text = I dropped her
hand and made a movement as though to walk away.

<Sent id="644">
Text = But we were mistaken,
it was not he.

"What are you afraid of?

<Sent id="645">

giving it to me again. "Come, what is it?

<Sent id="646">
Text = We will meet him together;

<Sent id="647">

want him to see how fond we are of each other."

"How fond we are of each other!" I cried. ("Oh, Nastenka, Nastenka," I
thought, "how much you have told me in that saying!

<Sent id="648">

_certain_ moments makes the heart cold and the soul heavy.

cold, mine burns like fire.

unbearable a happy person is sometimes!

you!")
</Sent>
<Sent id="653">
Text = At last my heart was too full.

"Listen, Nastenka!" I cried. "Do you know how it has been with me all
day."

"Why, how, how?
</Sent>
<Sent id="654">
Text = Tell me quickly!
</Sent>
<Sent id="655">
Text = Why have you said nothing all this
time?"

"To begin with, Nastenka, when I had carried out all your commissions,
given the letter, gone to see your good friends, then ... then I went
home and went to bed."

"Is that all?" she interrupted, laughing.

"Yes, almost all," I answered restraining myself, for foolish tears were
already starting into my eyes. "I woke an hour before our appointment,
and yet, as it were, I had not been asleep.
</Sent>
<Sent id="656">
Text = I don't know what happened
to me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="657">

standing still, feeling as though one sensation, one feeling must remain
with me from that time for ever; feeling as though one minute must go on
for all eternity, and as though all life had come to a standstill for
me....
</Sent>
<Sent id="658">
Text = When I woke up it seemed as though some musical motive long
familiar, heard somewhere in the past, forgotten and voluptuously sweet,
had come back to me now.

<Sent id="659">
Text = It seemed to me that it had been clamouring at
my heart all my life, and only now...."

"Oh my goodness, my goodness," Nastenka interrupted, "what does all that
mean?
</Sent>
<Sent id="660">
Text = I don't understand a word."

"Ah, Nastenka, I wanted somehow to convey to you that strange
impression...." I began in a plaintive voice, in which there still lay
hid a hope, though a very faint one.

"Leave off.
</Sent>
<Sent id="661">
Text = Hush!" she said, and in one instant the sly puss had
guessed.
</Sent>
<Sent id="662">
Text = Suddenly she became extraordinarily talkative, gay, mischievous; she
took my arm, laughed, wanted me to laugh too, and every confused word I
uttered evoked from her prolonged ringing laughter....
</Sent>
<Sent id="663">
Text = I began to feel
angry, she had suddenly begun flirting.

"Do you know," she began, "I feel a little vexed that you are not in
love with me?
</Sent>
<Sent id="664">
Text = There's no understanding human nature!
</Sent>
<Sent id="665">
Text = But all the same,
Mr. Unapproachable, you cannot blame me for being so simple;

<Sent id="666">
Text = I tell you
everything, everything, whatever foolish thought comes into my head."

"Listen!
</Sent>
<Sent id="667">
Text = That's eleven, I believe," I said as the slow chime of a bell
rang out from a distant tower.
</Sent>
<Sent id="668">
Text = She suddenly stopped, left off laughing
and began to count.

"Yes, it's eleven," she said at last in a timid, uncertain voice.
</Sent>
<Sent id="669">
Text = I regretted at once that I had frightened her, making her count the
strokes, and I cursed myself for my spiteful impulse;
</Sent>
<Sent id="670">
Text = I felt sorry for
her, and did not know how to atone for what I had done.
</Sent>
<Sent id="671">
Text = I began comforting her, seeking for reasons for his not coming,
advancing various arguments, proofs.
</Sent>
<Sent id="672">
Text = No one could have been easier to
deceive than she was at that moment; and, indeed, any one at such a
moment listens gladly to any consolation, whatever it may be, and is
overjoyed if a shadow of excuse can be found.

"And indeed it's an absurd thing," I began, warming to my task and
admiring the extraordinary clearness of my argument, "why, he could not
have come; you have muddled and confused me, Nastenka, so that I too,
have lost count of the time....
</Sent>
<Sent id="673">
Text = Only think: he can scarcely have
received the letter; suppose he is not able to come, suppose he is going
to answer the letter, could not come before to-morrow.

<Sent id="674">
Text = I will go for it
as soon as it's light to-morrow and let you know at once.
</Sent>
<Sent id="675">
Text = Consider,
there are thousands of possibilities; perhaps he was not at home when
the letter came, and may not have read it even now!
</Sent>
<Sent id="676">
Text = Anything may happen,
you know."

"Yes, yes!" said Nastenka. "I did not think of that.
</Sent>
<Sent id="677">
Text = Of course anything
may happen?" she went on in a tone that offered no opposition, though
some other far-away thought could be heard like a vexatious discord in
it. "I tell you what you must do," she said, "you go as early as
possible to-morrow morning, and if you get anything let me know at once.
</Sent>
<Sent id="678">
Text = You know where I live, don't you?"
</Sent>
<Sent id="679">
Text = And she began repeating her address to me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="680">
Text = Then she suddenly became so tender, so solicitous with me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="681">
Text = She seemed to
listen attentively to what I told her; but when I asked her some
question she was silent, was confused, and turned her head away.
</Sent>
<Sent id="682">
Text = I
looked into her eyes--yes, she was crying.

"How can you?
</Sent>
<Sent id="683">
Text = How can you?
</Sent>
<Sent id="684">
Text = Oh, what a baby you are! what
childishness!...
</Sent>
<Sent id="685">
Text = Come, come!"
</Sent>
<Sent id="686">
Text = She tried to smile, to calm herself, but her chin was quivering and her
bosom was still heaving.

"I was thinking about you," she said after a minute's silence. "You are
so kind that I should be a stone if I did not feel it.
</Sent>
<Sent id="687">
Text = Do you know what
has occurred to me now?
</Sent>
<Sent id="688">
Text = I was comparing you two.

</Sent>
<Sent id="690">
Text = Why
isn't he like you?
</Sent>
<Sent id="691">
Text = He is not as good as you, though I love him more than
you."
</Sent>
<Sent id="692">
Text = I made no answer.
</Sent>
<Sent id="693">
Text = She seemed to expect me to say something.

"Of course, it may be that I don't understand him fully yet.
</Sent>
<Sent id="694">
Text = You know I
was always as it were afraid of him; he was always so grave, as it were
so proud.
</Sent>
<Sent id="695">
Text = Of course I know it's only that he seems like that, I know
there is more tenderness in his heart than in mine....
</Sent>
<Sent id="696">
Text = I remember how he
looked at me when I went in to him--do you remember?--with my bundle;
but yet I respect him too much, and doesn't that show that we are not
equals?"

"No, Nastenka, no," I answered, "it shows that you love him more than
anything in the world, and far more than yourself."

"Yes, supposing that is so," answered Nastenka naïvely. "But do you know
what strikes me now?
</Sent>
<Sent id="697">
Text = Only I am not talking about him now, but speaking
generally; all this came into my mind some time ago.
</Sent>
<Sent id="698">
Text = Tell me, how is it
that we can't all be like brothers together?
</Sent>
<Sent id="699">
Text = Why is it that even the
best of men always seem to hide something from other people and to keep
something back?
</Sent>
<Sent id="700">
Text = Why not say straight out what is in one's heart, when
one knows that one is not speaking idly?
</Sent>
<Sent id="701">
Text = As it is every one seems
harsher than he really is, as though all were afraid of doing injustice
to their feelings, by being too quick to express them."

"Oh, Nastenka, what you say is true; but there are many reasons for
that," I broke in suppressing my own feelings at that moment more than
ever.

"No, no!" she answered with deep feeling. "Here you, for instance, are
not like other people!
</Sent>
<Sent id="702">
Text = I really don't know how to tell you what I feel;
but it seems to me that you, for instance ... at the present moment ...
it seems to me that you are sacrificing something for me," she added
timidly, with a fleeting glance at me. "Forgive me for saying so, I am a
simple girl you know.
</Sent>
<Sent id="703">
Text = I have seen very little of life, and I really
sometimes don't know how to say things," she added in a voice that
quivered with some hidden feeling, while she tried to smile; "but I only
wanted to tell you that I am grateful, that I feel it all too....
</Sent>
<Sent id="704">
Text = Oh,
may God give you happiness for it!
</Sent>
<Sent id="705">
Text = What you told me about your dreamer
is quite untrue now--that is, I mean, it's not true of you.
</Sent>
<Sent id="706">
Text = You are
recovering, you are quite a different man from what you described.
</Sent>
<Sent id="707">
Text = If
you ever fall in love with some one, God give you happiness with her!
</Sent>
<Sent id="708">
Text = I
won't wish anything for her, for she will be happy with you.
</Sent>
<Sent id="709">
Text = I know, I
am a woman myself, so you must believe me when I tell you so."
</Sent>
<Sent id="710">
Text = She ceased speaking, and pressed my hand warmly.
</Sent>
<Sent id="711">
Text = I too could not speak
without emotion.
</Sent>
<Sent id="712">
Text = Some minutes passed.

"Yes, it's clear he won't come to-night," she said at last raising her
head. "It's late."

"He will come to-morrow," I said in the most firm and convincing tone.

"Yes," she added with no sign of her former depression. "I see for
myself now that he could not come till to-morrow.
</Sent>
<Sent id="713">
Text = Well, good-bye, till
to-morrow.

<Sent id="714">
Text = If it rains perhaps I shall not come.

<Sent id="715">
Text = But the day after
to-morrow, I shall come.

<Sent id="716">
Text = I shall come for certain, whatever happens; be
sure to be here, I want to see you, I will tell you everything."
</Sent>
<Sent id="717">
Text = And then when we parted she gave me her hand and said, looking at me
candidly: "We shall always be together, shan't we?"
</Sent>
<Sent id="718">
Text = Oh, Nastenka, Nastenka!
</Sent>
<Sent id="719">
Text = If only you knew how lonely I am now!
</Sent>
<Sent id="720">
Text = As soon as it struck nine o'clock I could not stay indoors, but put on
my things, and went out in spite of the weather.
</Sent>
<Sent id="721">
Text = I was there, sitting on
our seat.
</Sent>
<Sent id="722">
Text = I went to her street, but I felt ashamed, and turned back
without looking at their windows, when I was two steps from her door.
</Sent>
<Sent id="723">
Text = I
went home more depressed than I had ever been before.
</Sent>
<Sent id="724">
Text = What a damp,
dreary day!

letter has not come to-day, however.

are together by now....

<Sent id="733">

<Sent id="734">
Text = I arrived at
nine o'clock.
</Sent>
<Sent id="735">
Text = She was already there.
</Sent>
<Sent id="736">
Text = I noticed her a good way off; she
was standing as she had been that first time, with her elbows on the
railing, and she did not hear me coming up to her.

"Nastenka!" I called to her, suppressing my agitation with an effort.
</Sent>
<Sent id="737">
Text = She turned to me quickly.

"Well?" she said. "Well?
</Sent>
<Sent id="738">
Text = Make haste!"
</Sent>
<Sent id="739">
Text = I looked at her in perplexity.

"Well, where is the letter?
</Sent>
<Sent id="740">
Text = Have you brought the letter?" she repeated
clutching at the railing.

"No, there is no letter," I said at last. "Hasn't he been to you yet?"
She turned fearfully pale and looked at me for a long time without
moving.
</Sent>
<Sent id="741">
Text = I had shattered her last hope.

"Well, God be with him," she said at last in a breaking voice; "God be
with him if he leaves me like that."
</Sent>
<Sent id="742">
Text = She dropped her eyes, then tried to look at me and could not.
</Sent>
<Sent id="743">
Text = For
several minutes she was struggling with her emotion.
</Sent>
<Sent id="744">
Text = All at once she
turned away, leaning her elbows against the railing and burst into
tears.

"Oh don't, don't!" I began; but looking at her I had not the heart to go
on, and what was I to say to her?

"Don't try and comfort me," she said; "don't talk about him; don't tell
me that he will come, that he has not cast me off so cruelly and so
inhumanly as he has.
</Sent>
<Sent id="745">
Text = What for--what for?
</Sent>
<Sent id="746">
Text = Can there have been something
in my letter, that unlucky letter?"
</Sent>
<Sent id="747">
Text = At that point sobs stifled her voice; my heart was torn as I looked at
her.

"Oh, how inhumanly cruel it is!" she began again. "And not a line, not a
line!
</Sent>
<Sent id="748">
Text = He might at least have written that he does not want me, that he
rejects me--but not a line for three days!

<Sent id="749">
Text = How easy it is for him to
wound, to insult a poor, defenceless girl, whose only fault is that she
loves him!

Text = Oh, what I've suffered during these three days!
</Sent>
<Sent id="751">
Text = Oh, dear!

<Sent id="752">
Text = When I think that I was the first to go to him, that I humbled myself
before him, cried, that I begged of him a little love!... and after
that!

<Sent id="753">
Text = Listen," she said, turning to me, and her black eyes flashed, "it
isn't so!
</Sent>
<Sent id="754">
Text = It can't be so; it isn't natural.

<Sent id="755">
Text = Either you are mistaken or
I; perhaps he has not received the letter?

Text = Perhaps he still knows
nothing about it?

<Sent id="757">
Text = How could any one--judge for yourself, tell me, for
goodness' sake explain it to me, I can't understand it--how could any
one behave with such barbarous coarseness as he has behaved to me?

Text = Not
one word!

<Sent id="759">
Text = Why, the lowest creature on earth is treated more
compassionately.

told him something about me," she cried, turning to me inquiringly:
"What do you think?"

"Listen, Nastenka, I shall go to him to-morrow in your name."

"Yes?"

"I will question him about everything;

<Sent id="761">
Text = I will tell him everything."

"Yes, yes?"

"You write a letter.

him respect your action, he shall hear all about it, and if----"

"No, my friend, no," she interrupted. "Enough!

another line from me--enough!

more.

<Sent id="768">
Text = She could not go on.

"Calm yourself, calm yourself!

<Sent id="769">
Text = Sit here, Nastenka," I said, making her
sit down on the seat.

"I am calm.

<Sent id="770">
Text = Don't trouble.

<Sent id="771">
Text = It's nothing!

<Sent id="772">

dry.

Text = Why, do you imagine I shall do away with myself, that I shall throw
myself into the river?"

<Sent id="774">

"Listen," she said taking my hand. "Tell me: you wouldn't have behaved
like this, would you?

Text = You would not have abandoned a girl who had come
to you of herself, you would not have thrown into her face a shameless
taunt at her weak foolish heart?

<Sent id="777">

would have realized that she was alone, that she did not know how to
look after herself, that she could not guard herself from loving you,
that it was not her fault, not her fault--that she had done nothing....

Text = Oh dear, oh dear!"

"Nastenka!" I cried at last, unable to control my emotion. "Nastenka,
you torture me!

surging in my heart!"

in surprise.

"What is the matter with you?" she said at last.

"Listen," I said resolutely. "Listen to me, Nastenka!

Text = What I am going to
say to you now is all nonsense, all impossible, all stupid!

suffering now, I beg you beforehand to forgive me!"

"What is it?

<Sent id="787">
Text = What is it?" she said drying her tears and looking at me
intently, while a strange curiosity gleamed in her astonished eyes.
"What is the matter?"

"It's impossible, but I love you, Nastenka!

<Sent id="788">
Text = There it is!
</Sent>
<Sent id="789">
Text = Now everything
is told," I said with a wave of my hand. "Now you will see whether you
can go on talking to me as you did just now, whether you can listen to
what I am going to say to you."...

"Well, what then?" Nastenka interrupted me. "What of it?

<Sent id="790">
Text = I knew you
loved me long ago, only I always thought that you simply liked me very
much....

"At first it was simply liking, Nastenka, but now, now!

same position as you were when you went to him with your bundle.

worse position than you, Nastenka, because he cared for no one else as
you do."

"What are you saying to me!

eyes.

"What's to be done, Nastenka, what am I to do?

in any way, I cannot wound you!

"No, Nastenka, I won't sit down;

it is your fault, your fault and not mine.

"No, no, I don't drive you away, no!" said Nastenka, concealing her
confusion as best she could, poor child.

"You don't drive me away?

go away, but first I will tell you all, for when you were crying here I
could not sit unmoved, when you wept, when you were in torture at

your love being repulsed, I felt that in my heart there was so much love
for you, Nastenka, so much love!

what was done could never be undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing,

enjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness of one's own
degradation; it was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last
barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that
there was no escape for you; that you never could become a different
man; that even if time and faith were still left you to change into
something different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you
did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality
there was nothing for you to change into.

nothing.

it is insulting all the same.

despise anything; to give way, to yield, from policy; never to lose
sight of a useful practical object (such as rent-free quarters at the
government expense, pensions, decorations), to keep their eye on that
object through all the enthusiasms and volumes of lyrical poems, and at
the same time to preserve "the good and the beautiful" inviolate within
them to the hour of their death, and to preserve themselves also,

change the collar at any sacrifice, and to have a beaver one like an

incapacity and insignificance.

lower forms he had simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody

he was a pretty and playful boy.

got worse and worse as he went on; however, he left with a good
certificate, as he had powerful interest.

<Sent id="1923">
Text = During his last year at school
he came in for an estate of two hundred serfs, and as almost all of us
were poor he took up a swaggering tone among us.

<Sent id="1924">
Text = He was vulgar in the
extreme, but at the same time he was a good-natured fellow, even in his
swaggering.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1925">
Text = In spite of superficial, fantastic and sham notions of
honour and dignity, all but very few of us positively grovelled before
Zverkov, and the more so the more he swaggered.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1926">
Text = And it was not from any
interested motive that they grovelled, but simply because he had been
favoured by the gifts of nature.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1927">
Text = Moreover, it was, as it were, an
accepted idea among us that Zverkov was a specialist in regard to tact
and the social graces.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1928">
Text = This last fact particularly infuriated me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1929">
Text = I
hated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his admiration of his
own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid, though he was bold
in his language;
</Sent>
<Sent id="1930">
Text = I hated his handsome, but stupid face (for which I
would, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent one), and the
free-and-easy military manners in fashion in the "'forties." I hated the
way in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women (he did
not venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the epaulettes
of an officer, and was looking forward to them with impatience), and
boasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1931">
Text = I remember how I,
invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened upon Zverkov, when one day
talking at a leisure moment with his schoolfellows of his future
relations with the fair sex, and growing as sportive as a puppy in the
sun, he all at once declared that he would not leave a single village
girl on his estate unnoticed, that that was his _droit de seigneur_, and
that if the peasants dared to protest he would have them all flogged and
double the tax on them, the bearded rascals.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1932">
Text = Our servile rabble
applauded, but I attacked him, not from compassion for the girls and
their fathers, but simply because they were applauding such an insect.

<Sent id="1933">

got the better of him on that occasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he
was lively and impudent, and so laughed it off, and in such a way that
my victory was not really complete: the laugh was on his side.

<Sent id="1934">
Text = He got
the better of me on several occasions afterwards, but without malice,
jestingly, casually.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1935">

would not answer him.

<Sent id="1937">
Text = I did
not rebuff them, for I was flattered, but we soon parted and quite
naturally.

<Sent id="1938">
Text = Afterwards I heard of his barrack-room success as a
lieutenant, and of the fast life he was leading.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1939">
Text = Then there came other
rumours--of his successes in the service.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1940">
Text = By then he had taken to
cutting me in the street, and I suspected that he was afraid of
compromising himself by greeting a personage as insignificant as me.

saw him once in the theatre, in the third tier of boxes.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1942">

wearing shoulder-straps.

ingratiating himself with the daughters of an ancient General.

years he had gone off considerably, though he was still rather handsome
and adroit.

give a dinner on his departure.

three years, though privately they did not consider themselves on an
equal footing with him, I am convinced of that.

little fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always
deriding every one, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the
lower forms--a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most
sensitive feeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a
wretched little coward at heart.

Zverkov who made up to the latter from interested motives, and often
borrowed money from him.

person in no way remarkable--a tall young fellow, in the army, with a
cold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success of every sort,
and was only capable of thinking of promotion.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1951">
Text = He was some sort of
distant relation of Zverkov's, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him a
certain importance among us.

whatever; his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was
tolerable.

"Well, with seven roubles each," said Trudolyubov, "twenty-one roubles
between the three of us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner.

<Sent id="1953">

"Of course not, since we are inviting him," Simonov decided.

"Can you imagine," Ferfitchkin interrupted hotly and conceitedly, like
some insolent flunkey boasting of his master the General's decorations,
"can you imagine that Zverkov will let us pay alone?
</Sent>
<Sent id="1954">
Text = He will accept from
delicacy, but he will order half a dozen bottles of champagne."

"Do we want half a dozen for the four of us?" observed Trudolyubov,
taking notice only of the half dozen.

"So the three of us, with Zverkov for the fourth, twenty-one roubles, at
the Hôtel de Paris at five o'clock to-morrow," Simonov, who had been
asked to make the arrangements, concluded finally.

"How twenty-one roubles?" I asked in some agitation, with a show of
being offended; "if you count me it will not be twenty-one, but
twenty-eight roubles."
</Sent>
<Sent id="1955">
Text = It seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly would
be positively graceful, and that they would all be conquered at once and
would look at me with respect.

"Do you want to join, too?" Simonov observed, with no appearance of
pleasure, seeming to avoid looking at me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1956">

through.

<Sent id="1957">

"Why not?

<Sent id="1958">
Text = I am an old schoolfellow of his, too, I believe, and I must
own I feel hurt that you have left me out," I said, boiling over again.

"And where were we to find you?" Ferfitchkin put in roughly.

"You never were on good terms with Zverkov," Trudolyubov added,
frowning.
</Sent>
<Sent id="1959">
Text = But I had already clutched at the idea and would not give it up.

"It seems to me that no one has a right to form an opinion upon that," I
retorted in a shaking voice, as though something tremendous had
happened. "Perhaps that is just my reason for wishing it now, that I
have not always been on good terms with him."

"Oh, there's no making you out ... with these refinements," Trudolyubov
jeered.

"We'll put your name down," Simonov decided, addressing me. "To-morrow
at five o'clock at the Hôtel de Paris."

"What about the money?" Ferfitchkin began in an undertone, indicating me
to Simonov, but he broke off, for even Simonov was embarrassed.

"That will do," said Trudolyubov, getting up. "If he wants to come so
much, let him."

"But it's a private thing, between us friends," Ferfitchkin said
crossly, as he, too, picked up his hat. "It's not an official
gathering."

"We do not want at all, perhaps...."

somewhat abashed.

"My goodness, why didn't you say so?" I cried, seizing my cap, with an
astonishingly free-and-easy air, which was the last thing I should have
expected of myself.

"It's close by ... not two paces away," Simonov repeated, accompanying
me to the front door with a fussy air which did not suit him at all. "So
five o'clock, punctually, to-morrow," he called down the stairs after
me.

reproaches, already troubled by doubt, and looking with savage distrust
at every one.

games, their conversations.

sixteen they were already talking about a snug berth.

they had always been surrounded in their childhood and boyhood.

were monstrously depraved.

a victory over him, to subjugate him and nothing else.

Simonov's!

believed that some radical change in my life was coming, and would
inevitably come that day.

consider, and they all agitated and overwhelmed me.

a second time with my own hands; nothing in the world would have induced
Apollon to clean them twice a day, as he considered that it was more
than his duties required of him.

the passage, being careful he should not detect it, for fear of his
contempt.

trousers was a big yellow stain.

that it was very poor to think so. "But this is no time for thinking:
now I am in for the real thing," I thought, and my heart sank.

<Sent id="2045">
Text = I could not control myself and was
already shaking with fever.

<Sent id="2046">

and disdainfully that "scoundrel" Zverkov would meet me; with what
dull-witted, invincible contempt the blockhead Trudolyubov would look at
me; with what impudent rudeness the insect Ferfitchkin would snigger at
me in order to curry favour with Zverkov; how completely Simonov would
take it all in, and how he would despise me for the abjectness of my
vanity and lack of spirit--and, worst of all, how paltry, _unliterary_,
commonplace it would all be.

<Sent id="2047">
Text = Of course, the best thing would be not to
go at all.

<Sent id="2048">
Text = But that was most impossible of all: if I feel impelled to do
anything, I seem to be pitchforked into it.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2049">
Text = I should have jeered at
myself ever afterwards: "So you funked it, you funked it, you funked the
_real thing_!" On the contrary, I passionately longed to show all that
"rabble" that I was by no means such a spiritless creature as I seemed
to myself.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2050">
Text = What is more, even in the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly
fever, I dreamed of getting the upper hand, of dominating them, carrying
them away, making them like me--if only for my "elevation of thought and
unmistakable wit." They would abandon Zverkov, he would sit on one side,
silent and ashamed, while I should crush him.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2051">
Text = Then, perhaps, we would be
reconciled and drink to our everlasting friendship; but what was most
bitter and most humiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully
and for certain, that I needed nothing of all this really, that I did
not really want to crush, to subdue, to attract them, and that I did not
care a straw really for the result, even if I did achieve it.

prayed for the day to pass quickly!

window, opened the movable pane and looked out into the troubled
darkness of the thickly falling wet snow.

clock hissed out five.

Apollon, who had been all day expecting his month's wages, but in his
foolishness was unwilling to be the first to speak about it, I slipt
between him and the door and jumping into a high-class sledge, on which
I spent my last half rouble, I drove up in grand style to the Hôtel de
Paris.

from the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for
six o'clock.

to go on questioning them.

they changed the dinner hour they ought at least to have let me

position in my own eyes and ... and even before the waiters.

the servant began laying the table;

however, to bring them in at once when I arrived.

<Sent id="2071">
Text = In the next room two
gloomy, angry-looking persons were eating their dinners in silence at
two different tables.

<Sent id="2072">
Text = There was a great deal of noise, even shouting, in
a room further away; one could hear the laughter of a crowd of people,
and nasty little shrieks in French: there were ladies at the dinner.

<Sent id="2073">
Text = It
was sickening, in fact.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2074">
Text = I rarely passed more unpleasant moments, so much
so that when they did arrive all together punctually at six I was
overjoyed to see them, as though they were my deliverers, and even
forgot that it was incumbent upon me to show resentment.

<Sent id="2075">
Text = Zverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading
spirit.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2076">
Text = He and all of them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew
himself up a little, walked up to me deliberately with a slight, rather
jaunty bend from the waist.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2077">
Text = He shook hands with me in a friendly, but
not over-friendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like
that of a General, as though in giving me his hand he were warding off
something.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2078">
Text = I had imagined, on the contrary, that on coming in he would
at once break into his habitual thin, shrill laugh and fall to making
his insipid jokes and witticisms.

<Sent id="2079">
Text = I had been preparing for them ever
since the previous day, but I had not expected such condescension, such
high-official courtesy.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2080">
Text = So, then, he felt himself ineffably superior to
me in every respect!
</Sent>
<Sent id="2081">
Text = If he only meant to insult me by that high-official
tone, it would not matter, I thought--I could pay him back for it one
way or another.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2082">
Text = But what if, in reality, without the least desire to be
offensive, that sheepshead had a notion in earnest that he was superior
to me and could only look at me in a patronizing way?
</Sent>
<Sent id="2083">
Text = The very
supposition made me gasp.

"I was surprised to hear of your desire to join us," he began, lisping
and drawling, which was something new. "You and I seem to have seen
nothing of one another.

such terrible people as you think.

acquaintance."

<Sent id="2087">
Text = And he turned carelessly to put down his hat on the window.

"Have you been waiting long?" Trudolyubov inquired.

"I arrived at five o'clock as you told me yesterday," I answered aloud,
with an irritability that threatened an explosion.

"Didn't you let him know that we had changed the hour?" said Trudolyubov
to Simonov.

"No, I didn't. I forgot," the latter replied, with no sign of regret,
and without even apologizing to me he went off to order the _hors
d'oeuvres_.

"So you've been here a whole hour?

<Sent id="2088">
Text = Oh, poor fellow!" Zverkov cried
ironically, for to his notions this was bound to be extremely funny.

puppy yapping.

<Sent id="2090">
Text = My position struck him, too, as exquisitely ludicrous and
embarrassing.

"It isn't funny at all!" I cried to Ferfitchkin, more and more
irritated. "It wasn't my fault, but other people's. They neglected to
let me know.

<Sent id="2091">

"It's not only absurd, but something else as well," muttered
Trudolyubov, naïvely taking my part. "You are not hard enough upon it.

<Sent id="2092">
Text = It was simply rudeness--unintentional, of course.

<Sent id="2093">
Text = And how could Simonov
... h'm!"

"If a trick like that had been played on me," observed Ferfitchkin, "I
should...."

"But you should have ordered something for yourself," Zverkov
interrupted, "or simply asked for dinner without waiting for us."

"You will allow that I might have done that without your permission," I
rapped out. "If I waited, it was...."

"Let us sit down, gentlemen," cried Simonov, coming in. "Everything is

suddenly turned to me, but again he seemed to avoid looking at me.

next to him, between him and Trudolyubov.

"Tell me, are you ... in a government office?" Zverkov went on attending
to me.

to be friendly to me, and, so to speak, cheer me up.

"What ma-a-de me was that I wanted to leave my original job," I drawled
more than he, hardly able to control myself.

salary was.

"It is not very handsome," Zverkov observed majestically.

"Yes, you can't afford to dine at cafés on that," Ferfitchkin added
insolently.

"To my thinking it's very poor," Trudolyubov observed gravely.

"And how thin you have grown!

a shade of venom in his voice, scanning me and my attire with a sort of
insolent compassion.

"Oh, spare his blushes," cried Ferfitchkin, sniggering.

"My dear sir, allow me to tell you I am not blushing," I broke out at
last; "do you hear?

looking me in the face with fury.

"Tha-at," I answered, feeling I had gone too far, "and I imagine it
would be better to talk of something more intelligent."

"You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?"

"Don't disturb yourself, that would be quite out of place here."

"Why are you clacking away like that, my good sir, eh?

farewell dinner to a comrade and you carry on an altercation," said
Trudolyubov, rudely addressing himself to me alone. "You invited

this affair by an intimate friend of his, a Prince Kolya, an officer in
the hussars, who had three thousand serfs.

checking the general indignation. "I thank you all, but I can show him
for myself how much value I attach to his words."

extraordinary grace and beauty of a Princess D., whom none of them had

sullenly in the snowy darkness like torches at a funeral.

there.

where there was only one candle burning, and stood still in amazement:
there was no one there. "Where are they?" I asked somebody.

two wide open eyes scrutinizing me curiously and persistently.

weighed upon me.

horrible sensation, such as one feels when one goes into a damp and
mouldy cellar.

beginning to look at me only now.

considered it utterly superfluous; in fact, the silence had for some
reason gratified me.

idea--revolting as a spider--of vice, which, without love, grossly and
shamelessly begins with that in which true love finds its consummation.

Text = For a long time we gazed at each other like that, but she did not drop
her eyes before mine and her expression did not change, so that at last
I felt uncomfortable.

"Liza," she answered almost in a whisper, but somehow far from
graciously, and she turned her eyes away.

my will, flitting through my memory in confusion.

something I had seen that morning when, full of anxious thoughts, I was
hurrying to the office.

"I saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped it,"
I suddenly said aloud, not that I desired to open the conversation, but
as it were by accident.

"A coffin?"

"Yes, in the Haymarket; they were bringing it up out of a cellar."

"From a cellar?"

"Not from a cellar, but from a basement.

"A nasty day to be buried," I began, simply to avoid being silent.

"Nasty, in what way?"

"The snow, the wet." (I yawned.)

"It makes no difference," she said suddenly, after a brief silence.

"No, it's horrid." (I yawned again.) "The gravediggers must have sworn
at getting drenched by the snow.

grave."

"Why water in the grave?" she asked, with a sort of curiosity, but
speaking even more harshly and abruptly than before.

"Why, there must have been water at the bottom a foot deep.

"Why?"

"Why?

them in water.

(I had never seen it once, indeed I had never been in Volkovo, and had
only heard stories of it.)

"Do you mean to say, you don't mind how you die?"

"But why should I die?" she answered, as though defending herself.

"Why, some day you will die, and you will die just the same as that dead
woman.

<Sent id="2421">
Text = She was ... a girl like you.

"A wench would have died in hospital...." (She knows all about it
already: she said "wench," not "girl.")

"She was in debt to her madam," I retorted, more and more provoked by
the discussion; "and went on earning money for her up to the end, though
she was in consumption.

"And is it better to die in a hospital?"

"Isn't it just the same?

irritably.

"If not now, a little later."

"Why a little later?"

"Why, indeed?

go off."

"In a year?"

"Anyway, in a year you will be worth less," I continued malignantly.
"You will go from here to something lower, another house; a year
later--to a third, lower and lower, and in seven years you will come to
a basement in the Haymarket.

"Oh, well, then I shall die," she answered, quite vindictively, and she
made a quick movement.

"Sorry for life."

movement.

begging her to calm herself, but felt that I did not dare; and all at
once, in a sort of cold shiver, almost in terror, began fumbling in the

face, with a half insane smile, looked at me almost senselessly.

down beside her and took her hands; she came to herself, made an
impulsive movement towards me, would have caught hold of me, but did not
dare, and slowly bowed her head before me.

"Liza, my dear, I was wrong ... forgive me, my dear," I began, but she
squeezed my hand in her fingers so tightly that I felt I was saying the
wrong thing and stopped.

"This is my address, Liza, come to me."

"I will come," she answered resolutely, her head still bowed.

"But now I am going, good-bye ... till we meet again."

shudder, snatched up a shawl that was lying on a chair and muffled
herself in it to her chin.

smile, blushed and looked at me strangely.

"Wait a minute," she said suddenly, in the passage just at the doorway,
stopping me with her hand on my overcoat.

haste and ran off; evidently she had thought of something or wanted to
show me something.

there was a smile on her lips--what was the meaning of it?

seemed to ask forgiveness for something.

face, not the same look as the evening before: sullen, mistrustful and
obstinate.

trustful, caressing, timid.

people they are very fond of, of whom they are asking a favour.

expressing love as well as sullen hatred.

understand everything without explanations, she held out a piece of
paper to me.

naïve, almost childish, triumph.

from a medical student or some one of that sort--a very high-flown and
flowery, but extremely respectful, love-letter.

now, but I remember well that through the high-flown phrases there was
apparent a genuine feeling, which cannot be feigned.

reading it I met her glowing, questioning, and childishly impatient eyes
fixed upon me.

a private house, a family of "very nice people, _who knew nothing_,
absolutely nothing, for she had only come here so lately and it had all
happened ... and she hadn't made up her mind to stay and was certainly
going away as soon as she had paid her debt ... and at that party there

to go away without knowing that she, too, was honestly and genuinely
loved; that she, too, was addressed respectfully.

was destined to lie in her box and lead to nothing.

am certain that she would keep it all her life as a precious treasure,

those "outcries of horror and pity." "To think of having such an attack
of womanish hysteria, pah!" I concluded.

reputation in the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov as quickly as possible;
that was the chief business.

my childhood, and you know--a desperate rake, fearfully spoilt--of

brilliant career; he is witty, charming, a regular Lovelace, you

good-breeding, and, above all, entirely without superfluous words, I
blamed myself for all that had happened.

may be allowed to defend myself," by alleging that being utterly
unaccustomed to wine, I had been intoxicated with the first glass, which
I said, I had drunk before they arrived, while I was waiting for them at
the Hôtel de Paris between five and six o'clock.

myself, but my head ached, and besides I had not the face to.

<Sent id="2753">
Text = I was
particularly pleased with a certain lightness, almost carelessness
(strictly within the bounds of politeness, however), which was apparent
in my style, and better than any possible arguments, gave them at once
to understand that I took rather an independent view of "all that
unpleasantness last night;" that I was by no means so utterly crushed as
you, my friends, probably imagine; but on the contrary, looked upon it
as a gentleman serenely respecting himself should look upon it. "On a
young hero's past no censure is cast!"

"There is actually an aristocratic playfulness about it!" I thought
admiringly, as I read over the letter.

intellectual and cultivated man!

jolly as ever again, and all because I am "a cultivated and educated man

yesterday.

it to Simonov.

Apollon became more respectful and agreed to take it.

went out for a walk.

conscience it would not die, and it showed itself in acute depression.

streets, along Myeshtchansky Street, along Sadovy Street and in Yusupov
Garden.

the dusk, just when there were crowds of working people of all sorts
going home from their daily work, with faces looking cross with anxiety.

Text = On this
occasion the jostling of the streets irritated me more than ever.

<Sent id="2771">
Text = I
could not make out what was wrong with me, I could not find the clue,
something seemed rising up continually in my soul, painfully, and
refusing to be appeased.

as though some crime were lying on my conscience.

to me that of all my recollections of yesterday this tormented me, as it
were, especially, as it were, quite separately.

quite succeeded in forgetting by the evening;

still perfectly satisfied with my letter to Simonov.

was not satisfied at all.

"What if she comes," I thought incessantly, "well, it doesn't matter,
let her come!

live.

horrid, though, that I have let myself go so, the room looks like a
beggar's. And I brought myself to go out to dinner in such a suit!

my American leather sofa with the stuffing sticking out.

dressing-gown, which will not cover me, such tatters, and she will see
all this and she will see Apollon.

shall be panic-stricken as usual, I shall begin bowing and scraping
before her and pulling my dressing-gown round me, I shall begin smiling,
telling lies.

that matters most!

viler!

"Why dishonest?

remember there was real feeling in me, too.

an honourable feeling in her....

have a good effect."

<Sent id="2799">
Text = All that evening, even when I had come
back home, even after nine o'clock, when I calculated that Liza could
not possibly come, she still haunted me, and what was worse, she came
back to my mind always in the same position.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2800">
Text = One moment out of all that
had happened last night stood vividly before my imagination; the moment
when I struck a match and saw her pale, distorted face, with its look of
torture.

<Sent id="2801">
Text = And what a pitiful, what an unnatural, what a distorted smile
she had at that moment!
</Sent>
<Sent id="2802">

later I should still in my imagination see Liza, always with the
pitiful, distorted, inappropriate smile which was on her face at that
minute.

Text = Next day I was ready again to look upon it all as nonsense, due to
over-excited nerves, and, above all, as _exaggerated_.

conscious of that weak point of mine, and sometimes very much afraid of
it. "I exaggerate everything, that is where I go wrong," I repeated to
myself every hour.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2805">
Text = But, however, "Liza will very likely come all the
same," was the refrain with which all my reflections ended.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2806">
Text = I was so
uneasy that I sometimes flew into a fury: "She'll come, she is certain
to come!" I cried, running about the room, "if not to-day, she will come
to-morrow; she'll find me out!

hearts!

fail to understand?..."

little of the idyllic (and affectedly, bookishly, artificially idyllic
too) had sufficed to turn a whole human life at once according to my
will.

beg her not to come to me.

that I believed I should have crushed that "damned" Liza if she had
chanced to be near me at the time.

at her, have turned her out, have struck her!

began to grow calmer.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2818">

o'clock, I even sometimes began dreaming, and rather sweetly: I, for
instance, became the salvation of Liza, simply through her coming to me
and my talking to her....

all confusion, transfigured, trembling and sobbing, she flings herself
at my feet and says that I am her saviour, and that she loves me better

imagine that I have not noticed your love, I saw it all, I divined it,
but I did not dare to approach you first, because I had an influence
over you and was afraid that you would force yourself, from gratitude,
to respond to my love, would try to rouse in your heart a feeling which
was perhaps absent, and I did not wish that ... because it would be
tyranny ... it would be indelicate (in short, I launch off at that point
into European, inexplicably lofty subtleties à la George Sand), but now,
now you are mine, you are my creation, you are pure, you are good, you
are my noble wife.

in the end it seemed vulgar to me myself, and I began putting out my
tongue at myself.

them go out very readily, especially in the evening (for some reason I
fancied she would come in the evening, and at seven o'clock precisely).

certain rights; so, h'm!

come!

bane of my life, the curse laid upon me by Providence.

squabbling continually for years, and I hated him.

him!

part of his time as a tailor.

beyond all measure, and looked down upon me insufferably.

<Sent id="2839">

indeed, he looked down upon every one.

<Sent id="2840">
Text = Simply to glance at that flaxen,
smoothly brushed head, at the tuft of hair he combed up on his forehead
and oiled with sunflower oil, at that dignified mouth, compressed into
the shape of the letter V, made one feel one was confronting a man who
never doubted of himself.

the greatest pedant I had met on earth, and with that had a vanity only
befitting Alexander of Macedon.

coat, every nail on his fingers--absolutely in love with them, and he
looked it!

little to me, and if he chanced to glance at me he gave me a firm,
majestically self-confident and invariably ironical look that drove me
sometimes to fury.

<Sent id="2844">

favour.

consider himself bound to do anything.

looked upon me as the greatest fool on earth, and that "he did not get
rid of me" was simply that he could get wages from me every month.

consented to do nothing for me for seven roubles a month.

such a point that sometimes his very step almost threw me into
convulsions.

have been a little too long or something of that sort, for he
continually lisped, and seemed to be very proud of it, imagining that it
greatly added to his dignity.

his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the ground.

me particularly when he read aloud the psalms to himself behind his
partition.

fond of reading aloud in the evenings, in a slow, even, sing-song voice,
as though over the dead.

ended: he hires himself out to read the psalms over the dead, and at the
same time he kills rats and makes blacking.

get rid of him, it was as though he were chemically combined with my
existence.

<Sent id="2858">
Text = Besides, nothing would have induced him to consent to leave
me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="2859">
Text = I could not live in furnished lodgings: my lodging was my private
solitude, my shell, my cave, in which I concealed myself from all
mankind, and Apollon seemed to me, for some reason, an integral part of
that flat, and for seven years I could not turn him away.

those days, that I made up my mind for some reason and with some object
to _punish_ Apollon and not to pay him for a fortnight the wages that
were owing him.

intending to do this, simply in order to teach him not to give himself
airs with me, and to show him that if I liked I could withhold his
wages.

silent indeed, in order to score off his pride and force him to be the
first to speak of his wages.

Text = Then I would take the seven roubles out of
a drawer, show him I have the money put aside on purpose, but that I
won't, I won't, I simply won't pay him his wages, I won't just because
that is "what I wish," because "I am master, and it is for me to
decide," because he has been disrespectful, because he has been rude;

him, otherwise he might wait another fortnight, another three weeks, a
whole month....

had been such cases already, there had been attempts (and it may be
observed I knew all this beforehand, I knew his nasty tactics by heart).

Text = He would begin by fixing upon me an exceedingly severe stare, keeping it
up for several minutes at a time, particularly on meeting me or seeing
me out of the house.

stares, he would, still in silence, proceed to further tortures.

once, _à propos_ of nothing, he would walk softly and smoothly into my
room, when I was pacing up and down or reading, stand at the door, one
hand behind his back and one foot behind the other, and fix upon me a
stare more than severe, utterly contemptuous.

what he wanted, he would make me no answer, but continue staring at me
persistently for some seconds, then, with a peculiar compression of his
lips and a most significant air, deliberately turn round and
deliberately go back to his room.

again and again present himself before me in the same way.

happened that in my fury I did not even ask him what he wanted, but
simply raised my head sharply and imperiously and began staring back at
him.

deliberation and dignity and went back again for two hours.

<Sent id="2876">
Text = If I were still not brought to reason by all this, but persisted in my
revolt, he would suddenly begin sighing while he looked at me, long,
deep sighs as though measuring by them the depths of my moral
degradation, and, of course, it ended at last by his triumphing
completely: I raged and shouted, but still was forced to do what he
wanted.

my temper and flew at him in a fury.

apart from him.

with one hand behind his back, to go to his room, "stay!

back, I tell you!" and I must have bawled so unnaturally, that he turned
round and even looked at me with some wonder.

saying nothing, and that infuriated me.

what did you come in to look at?"

"If you have any order to give me it's my duty to carry it out," he
answered, after another silent pause, with a slow, measured lisp,
raising his eyebrows and calmly twisting his head from one side to
another, all this with exasperating composure.

"That's not what I am asking you about, you torturer!" I shouted,
turning crimson with anger. "I'll tell you why you came here myself: you
see, I don't give you your wages, you are so proud you don't want to bow
down and ask for it, and so you come to punish me with your stupid
stares, to worry me and you have no sus...pic...ion how stupid it
is--stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!"...

"Listen," I shouted to him. "Here's the money, do you see, here it is"
(I took it out of the table drawer); "here's the seven roubles complete,
but you are not going to have it, you ... are ... not ... going ... to
... have it until you come respectfully with bowed head to beg my
pardon.

<Sent id="2886">
Text = Do you hear?"

"That cannot be," he answered, with the most unnatural self-confidence.

"It shall be so," I said, "I give you my word of honour, it shall be!"

"And there's nothing for me to beg your pardon for," he went on, as
though he had not noticed my exclamations at all. "Why, besides, you
called me a 'torturer,' for which I can summon you at the police-station
at any time for insulting behaviour."

"Go, summon me," I roared, "go at once, this very minute, this very
second!

<Sent id="2888">

to him, he walked to his room with an even step and without looking
round.

"If it had not been for Liza nothing of this would have happened," I
decided inwardly.

<Sent id="2889">
Text = Then, after waiting a minute, I went myself behind his
screen with a dignified and solemn air, though my heart was beating
slowly and violently.

"Apollon," I said quietly and emphatically, though I was breathless, "go
at once without a minute's delay and fetch the police-officer."

taken up some sewing.

"You are certainly out of your mind," he observed, without even raising
his head, lisping as deliberately as ever and threading his needle.
"Whoever heard of a man sending for the police against himself?

nothing will come of it."

him in a minute.

that instant and a figure come in, stop short, and begin staring at us
in perplexity.

my room.

against the wall and stood motionless in that position.

woman asking for you," he said, looking at me with peculiar severity.

us sarcastically.

ragged wadded dressing-gown--exactly as I had imagined the scene not
long before in a fit of depression.

<Sent id="2905">
Text = After standing over us for a couple
of minutes Apollon went away, but that did not make me more at ease.

more so, in fact, than I should have expected.

Text = At the sight of me, of
course.

"Sit down," I said mechanically, moving a chair up to the table, and I
sat down on the sofa.

open-eyed, evidently expecting something from me at once.

usual, while instead of that, she ... and I dimly felt that I should
make her pay dearly for _all this_.

"You have found me in a strange position, Liza," I began, stammering and
knowing that this was the wrong way to begin. "No, no, don't imagine
anything," I cried, seeing that she had suddenly flushed. "I am not
ashamed of my poverty....

"Apollon," I whispered in feverish haste, flinging down before him the
seven roubles which had remained all the time in my clenched fist, "here
are your wages, you see I give them to you; but for that you must come
to my rescue: bring me tea and a dozen rusks from the restaurant.

again, at first glanced askance at the money without speaking or putting
down his needle; then, without paying the slightest attention to me or
making any answer he went on busying himself with his needle, which he
had not yet threaded.

deliberately moved back his chair, deliberately took off his spectacles,
deliberately counted the money, and finally asking me over his shoulder:

was going back to Liza, the thought occurred to me on the way: shouldn't
I run away just as I was in my dressing-gown, no matter where, and then
let happen what would.

silent.

"I will kill him," I shouted suddenly, striking the table with my fist
so that the ink spurted out of the inkstand.

"What are you saying!" she cried, starting.

"I will kill him! kill him!" I shrieked, suddenly striking the table in
absolute frenzy, and at the same time fully understanding how stupid it
was to be in such a frenzy. "You don't know, Liza, what that torturer is

"What is the matter?

"Water, give me water, over there!" I muttered in a faint voice, though
I was inwardly conscious that I could have got on very well without
water and without muttering in a faint voice.

_putting it on_, to save appearances, though the attack was a genuine

brought in the tea.

prosaic tea was horribly undignified and paltry after all that had

alarm.

"Liza, do you despise me?" I asked, looking at her fixedly, trembling
with impatience to know what she was thinking.

"Drink your tea," I said to her angrily.

killed her.

not touch it.

begin alone.

<Sent id="2953">
Text = I
was obstinately silent.

because I was fully conscious of the disgusting meanness of my spiteful
stupidity, and yet at the same time I could not restrain myself.

"I want to ... get away ... from there altogether," she began, to break
the silence in some way, but, poor girl, that was just what she ought
not to have spoken about at such a stupid moment to a man so stupid as I
was.

unnecessary straightforwardness.

trembled with spite, and at once burst out.

her chair with an irresistible impulse and held out her hands, yearning
towards me, though still timid and not daring to stir....

there was a revulsion in my heart, too.

<Sent id="3023">

threw her arms round me and burst into tears.

myself, and sobbed as I never had before.

"They won't let me....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3025">

went to the sofa, fell on it face downwards, and sobbed on it for a
quarter of an hour in genuine hysterics.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3026">
Text = She came close to me, put her
arms round me and stayed motionless in that position.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3027">
Text = But the trouble
was that the hysterics could not go on for ever, and (I am writing the
loathsome truth) lying face downwards on the sofa with my face thrust
into my nasty leather pillow, I began by degrees to be aware of a
far-away, involuntary but irresistible feeling that it would be awkward
now for me to raise my head and look Liza straight in the face.

Text = Why was
I ashamed?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3029">

<Sent id="3030">
Text = The thought, too, came into
my overwrought brain that our parts now were completely changed, that
she was now the heroine, while I was just such a crushed and humiliated
creature as she had been before me that night--four days before....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3031">
Text = And
all this came into my mind during the minutes I was lying on my face on
the sofa.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3032">
Text = My God! surely I was not envious of her then.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3033">
Text = I don't know, to this day I cannot decide, and at the time, of course, I
was still less able to understand what I was feeling than now.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3034">

get on without domineering and tyrannizing over some one, but ... there
is no explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to reason.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3035">
Text = I conquered myself, however, and raised my head;
</Sent>
<Sent id="3036">
Text = I had to do so sooner
or later ... and I am convinced to this day that it was just because I
was ashamed to look at her that another feeling was suddenly kindled and
flamed up in my heart ... a feeling of mastery and possession.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3037">
Text = My eyes
gleamed with passion, and I gripped her hands tightly.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3038">
Text = How I hated her
and how I was drawn to her at that minute!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3039">
Text = The one feeling intensified
the other.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3040">
Text = It was almost like an act of vengeance.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3041">
Text = At first there was a
look of amazement, even of terror on her face, but only for one instant.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3042">
Text = She warmly and rapturously embraced me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3043">
Text = X
</Sent>
<Sent id="3044">
Text = A quarter of an hour later I was rushing up and down the room in
frenzied impatience, from minute to minute I went up to the screen and
peeped through the crack at Liza.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3045">
Text = She was sitting on the ground with her
head leaning against the bed, and must have been crying.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3046">
Text = But she did not
go away, and that irritated me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3047">
Text = This time she understood it all.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3048">
Text = I had
insulted her finally, but ... there's no need to describe it.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3049">
Text = She
realized that my outburst of passion had been simply revenge, a fresh
humiliation, and that to my earlier, almost causeless hatred was added
now a _personal hatred_, born of envy....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3050">
Text = Though I do not maintain
positively that she understood all this distinctly; but she certainly
did fully understand that I was a despicable man, and what was worse,
incapable of loving her.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3051">
Text = I know I shall be told that this is incredible--but it is incredible to
be as spiteful and stupid as I was; it may be added that it was strange
I should not love her, or at any rate, appreciate her love.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3052">
Text = Why is it
strange?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3053">
Text = In the first place, by then I was incapable of love, for I
repeat, with me loving meant tyrannizing and showing my moral
superiority.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3054">
Text = I have never in my life been able to imagine any other sort
of love, and have nowadays come to the point of sometimes thinking that
love really consists in the right--freely given by the beloved
object--to tyrannize over her.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3055">
Text = Even in my underground dreams I did not imagine love except as a
struggle.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3056">
Text = I began it always with hatred and ended it with moral
subjugation, and afterwards I never knew what to do with the subjugated
object.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3057">
Text = And what is there to wonder at in that, since I had succeeded in
so corrupting myself, since I was so out of touch with "real life," as
to have actually thought of reproaching her, and putting her to shame
for having come to me to hear "fine sentiments"; and did not even guess
that she had come not to hear fine sentiments, but to love me, because
to a woman all reformation, all salvation from any sort of ruin, and all
moral renewal is included in love and can only show itself in that form.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3058">
Text = I did not hate her so much, however, when I was running about the room
and peeping through the crack in the screen.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3059">
Text = I was only insufferably
oppressed by her being here.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3060">
Text = I wanted her to disappear.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3061">
Text = I wanted
"peace," to be left alone in my underground world.

<Sent id="3062">
Text = Real life oppressed
me with its novelty so much that I could hardly breathe.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3063">
Text = But several minutes passed and she still remained, without stirring, as
though she were unconscious.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3064">
Text = I had the shamelessness to tap softly at
the screen as though to remind her....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3065">
Text = She started, sprang up, and flew
to seek her kerchief, her hat, her coat, as though making her escape
from me....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3066">
Text = Two minutes later she came from behind the screen and looked
with heavy eyes at me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3067">
Text = I gave a spiteful grin, which was forced,
however, to _keep up appearances_, and I turned away from her eyes.

"Good-bye," she said, going towards the door.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3068">
Text = I ran up to her, seized her hand, opened it, thrust something in it and
closed it again.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3069">
Text = Then I turned at once and dashed away in haste to the
other corner of the room to avoid seeing, anyway....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3070">
Text = I did mean a moment since to tell a lie--to write that I did this
accidentally, not knowing what I was doing through foolishness, through
losing my head.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3071">
Text = But I don't want to lie, and so I will say straight out
that I opened her hand and put the money in it ... from spite.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3072">
Text = It came
into my head to do this while I was running up and down the room and she
was sitting behind the screen.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3073">
Text = But this I can say for certain: though I
did that cruel thing purposely, it was not an impulse from the heart,
but came from my evil brain.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3074">
Text = This cruelty was so affected, so purposely
made up, so completely a product of the brain, of books, that I could
not even keep it up a minute--first I dashed away to avoid seeing her,
and then in shame and despair rushed after Liza.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3075">
Text = I opened the door in
the passage and began listening.

"Liza!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3076">
Text = Liza!" I cried on the stairs, but in a low voice, not boldly.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3077">
Text = There was no answer, but I fancied I heard her footsteps, lower down on
the stairs.

"Liza!" I cried, more loudly.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3078">
Text = No answer.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3079">
Text = But at that minute I heard the stiff outer glass door open
heavily with a creak and slam violently, the sound echoed up the stairs.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3080">
Text = She had gone.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3081">
Text = I went back to my room in hesitation.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3082">
Text = I felt horribly
oppressed.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3083">
Text = I stood still at the table, beside the chair on which she had sat and
looked aimlessly before me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3084">
Text = A minute passed, suddenly I started;
straight before me on the table I saw....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3085">
Text = In short, I saw a crumpled
blue five-rouble note, the one I had thrust into her hand a minute
before.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3086">
Text = It was the same note; it could be no other, there was no other
in the flat.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3087">
Text = So she had managed to fling it from her hand on the table
at the moment when I had dashed into the further corner.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3088">
Text = Well!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3089">
Text = I might have expected that she would do that.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3090">
Text = Might I have
expected it?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3091">
Text = No, I was such an egoist, I was so lacking in respect for
my fellow-creatures that I could not even imagine she would do so.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3092">
Text = I
could not endure it.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3093">
Text = A minute later I flew like a madman to dress,
flinging on what I could at random and ran headlong after her.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3094">
Text = She could
not have got two hundred paces away when I ran out into the street.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3095">
Text = It was a still night and the snow was coming down in masses and falling
almost perpendicularly, covering the pavement and the empty street as
though with a pillow.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3096">
Text = There was no one in the street, no sound was to be
heard.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3097">
Text = The street lamps gave a disconsolate and useless glimmer.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3098">
Text = I ran
two hundred paces to the cross-roads and stopped short.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3099">
Text = Where had she gone?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3100">
Text = And why was I running after her?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3101">
Text = Why?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3102">
Text = To fall down before her, to sob with remorse, to kiss her feet, to
entreat her forgiveness!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3103">
Text = I longed for that, my whole breast was being
rent to pieces, and never, never shall I recall that minute with
indifference.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3104">
Text = But--what for?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3105">
Text = I thought.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3106">
Text = Should I not begin to hate her,
perhaps, even to-morrow, just because I had kissed her feet to-day?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3107">
Text = Should I give her happiness?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3108">
Text = Had I not recognized that day, for the
hundredth time, what I was worth?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3109">
Text = Should I not torture her?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3110">
Text = I stood in the snow, gazing into the troubled darkness and pondered
this.

"And will it not be better?" I mused fantastically, afterwards at home,
stifling the living pang of my heart with fantastic dreams. "Will it not
be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3111">
Text = Resentment--why, it is purification; it is a most stinging and painful
consciousness!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3112">
Text = To-morrow I should have defiled her soul and have
exhausted her heart, while now the feeling of insult will never die in
her heart, and however loathsome the filth awaiting her--the feeling of
insult will elevate and purify her ... by hatred ... h'm! ... perhaps,
too, by forgiveness....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3113">
Text = Will all that make things easier for her
though?..."
</Sent>
<Sent id="3114">
Text = And, indeed, I will ask on my own account here, an idle question: which
is better--cheap happiness or exalted sufferings?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3115">
Text = Well, which is better?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3116">
Text = So I dreamed as I sat at home that evening, almost dead with the pain in
my soul.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3117">
Text = Never had I endured such suffering and remorse, yet could there
have been the faintest doubt when I ran out from my lodging that I
should turn back half-way?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3118">
Text = I never met Liza again and I have heard
nothing of her.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3119">
Text = I will add, too, that I remained for a long time
afterwards pleased with the phrase about the benefit from resentment and
hatred in spite of the fact that I almost fell ill from misery.

<Sent id="3120">
Text = Even now, so many years later, all this is somehow a very evil memory.

<Sent id="3121">
Text = I
have many evil memories now, but ... hadn't I better end my "Notes"
here?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3122">
Text = I believe I made a mistake in beginning to write them, anyway I
have felt ashamed all the time I've been writing this story; so it's
hardly literature so much as a corrective punishment.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3123">
Text = Why, to tell long
stories, showing how I have spoiled my life through morally rotting in
my corner, through lack of fitting environment, through divorce from
real life, and rankling spite in my underground world, would certainly
not be interesting; a novel needs a hero, and all the traits for an
anti-hero are _expressly_ gathered together here, and what matters most,
it all produces an unpleasant impression, for we are all divorced from
life, we are all cripples, every one of us, more or less.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3124">
Text = We are so
divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real life,
and so cannot bear to be reminded of it.

looking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are all
privately agreed that it is better in books.

sometimes?

were answered.

Text = Come, try, give any one of us, for instance, a little
more independence, untie our hands, widen the spheres of our activity,
relax the control and we ... yes, I assure you ... we should be begging
to be under control again at once.

angry with me for that, and will begin shouting and stamping.

yourself, you will say, and for your miseries in your underground holes,
and don't dare to say all of us--excuse me, gentlemen, I am not
justifying myself with that "all of us." As for what concerns me in
particular I have only in my life carried to an extreme what you have
not dared to carry half-way, and what's more, you have taken your
cowardice for good sense, and have found comfort in deceiving
yourselves.

you.

what to respect and what to despise.

a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalized

not be regarded as unseemly and rather familiar.

<Sent id="3149">
Text = But, to do so, it would
first be necessary to explain and describe the rank and years and
calling and duty in the service, and even, indeed, the characters of the
persons concerned; and since there are so many writers who begin in that
way, the author of the proposed story, solely in order to be unlike them

boundless vanity), decides to begin straightaway with action.

arms like a baby, though the latter was by no means short, but rather
long and thin, and began dexterously carrying him up and down the room,

"I'll put you in your swaddling clothes, Master Bridegroom," he kept

Ivanovitch, and he actually looked into Vasya's face with genuine
uncertainty, but seeing in it the radiant confirmation of a positive
intention of being married as soon as possible, threw himself on the bed
and began rolling from side to side in ecstasy till the walls shook.

of delight broke from the powerful chest of Arkady Ivanovitch.

Madame Leroux, while maintaining her incontestable dignity and
pre-eminence in matters of taste, and remaining mute from condescension,

glance, gesture and smile saying at once: "Yes, you have chosen rightly,
and are worthy of the happiness which awaits you."

"It has been dangling its charms in coy seclusion," cried Vasya,
transferring his tender feelings to the charming cap. "You have been
hiding on purpose, you sly little pet!" And he kissed it, that is the
air surrounding it, for he was afraid to touch his treasure.

choice.

Madame Leroux, said something else very polite to her and left the shop.

a little noiseless, nervous laugh and dodging the passers-by, whom he
suspected of designs for crushing his precious cap.

good time for the holiday, eh?' he laughed.

Mastakovitch which directly or indirectly affected Vasya.

fascinated, genuinely fascinated; she admitted it herself; she purposely

something, and Arkady Ivanovitch gathered that she was referring to her
precious Vasya.

Arkady Ivanovitch was such a true friend of her betrothed, so loved him,
so watched over him, guiding him at every step with helpful advice, that
she, Lizanka, could hardly help thanking him, could not refrain from
feeling grateful, and hoping that Arkady Ivanovitch might like her, if
only half as well as Vasya.

<Sent id="3430">

Vasya was careful of his health, expressed some apprehensions in regard
to his marked impulsiveness of character, and his lack of knowledge of
men and practical life; she said that she would in time watch over him
religiously, that she would take care of and cherish his lot, and
finally, she hoped that Arkady Ivanovitch would not leave them, but
would live with them.

enthusiasm.

unfinished, but had been completely laid aside.

himself.

once to Vasya.

even observed that this was all that was needed to make them greater
friends than ever. "You have guessed my feelings, Vasya," said Arkady
Ivanovitch. "Yes, I love her as I love you; she will be my good angel as
well as yours, for the radiance of your happiness will be shed on me,
too, and I can bask in its warmth.

Ivanovitch was not very great at talking as a rule, he was not fond of
dreaming, either; now he gave way to the liveliest, freshest,

had, in short, been showing the most cordial response, suddenly
subsided, sank into silence, and almost ran along the street.

hurried questions from Vasya, who confined himself to a word or two,
sometimes an irrelevant exclamation.

"Why, what is the matter with you, Vasya?" he cried at last, hardly able
to keep up with him. "Can you really be so uneasy?"

"Oh, brother, that's enough chatter!" Vasya answered, with vexation.

"Don't be depressed, Vasya--come, come," Arkady interposed. "Why, I have

home in genuine anxiety.

silent; he noiselessly undressed and went to bed, keeping his eyes fixed
on Vasya....

him?" he thought to himself, looking at Vasya's face that grew whiter

every movement he made, "why, his hand is shaking ... what a stupid!

<Sent id="3497">

did I not advise him to sleep for a couple of hours, till he had slept
off his nervous excitement, any way." Vasya had just finished a page, he
raised his eyes, glanced casually at Arkady and at once, looking down,
took up his pen again.

"Listen, Vasya," Arkady Ivanovitch began suddenly, "wouldn't it be best
to sleep a little now?

smiled, but the same melancholy expression came back to his face at

rushing to the entry, "Petinka, you?"

"Good morning, I have the honour to wish you a happy New Year, Vassily
Petrovitch," said a pretty boy of ten years old with curly black hair.

give you a kiss for her."

eager arms.

luxuriant, jet-black hair; then he kissed it fervently and put it in his

resolutely at last.

be only this----"

"Don't, Vasya, don't!

<Sent id="3693">

at everything he came across, as though seeking at once some remedy for
Vasya. "I will go to Yulian Mastakovitch instead of you to-morrow.

will ask him--entreat him--to let you have another day.

it all to him, anything, if it worries you so...."

"God forbid!" cried Vasya, and turned as white as the wall.

scarcely stand on his feet.

"Vasya!

<Sent id="3699">
Text = His lips were quivering; he tried to say
something, but could only convulsively squeeze Arkady's hand in silence.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3700">
Text = His hand was cold.

Text = Arkady stood facing him, full of anxious and
miserable suspense.

Text = Vasya raised his eyes again.

"Vasya, God bless you, Vasya!

<Sent id="3703">

friend."

<Sent id="3704">

"I have deceived you, Arkady," he said. "I have deceived you.

me, forgive me!

"Look!"

<Sent id="3708">

table six thick manuscripts, similar to the one he had copied.

"What's this?"

"What I have to get through by the day after to-morrow.

quarter!

speaking at once of what was distressing him so terribly. "Arkady, dear
friend, I don't know myself what came over me.

coming out of a dream.

it.

senses."

"Vasya," began Arkady Ivanovitch resolutely, "Vasya, I will save you.

understand it all.

"Do you know that you are killing me now?" Vasya brought out, turning
cold with horror.

Text = Arkady Ivanovitch turned pale, but at once controlling himself, laughed.

"Is that all?

been living together for five years, thank God!

soft-hearted fellow, but weak, unpardonably weak.

Mikalovna has noticed it.

too; you may go from bad to worse, brother.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3739">
Text = I tell you, I know what you
want!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3740">
Text = You would like Yulian Mastakovitch, for instance, to be beside
himself and, maybe, to give a ball, too, from joy, because you are going
to get married....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3741">
Text = Stop, stop! you are frowning.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3742">

word from me you are offended on Yulian Mastakovitch's account.

<Sent id="3743">
Text = I'll let
him alone.

<Sent id="3744">
Text = You know I respect him just as much as you do.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3745">
Text = But argue as
you may, you can't prevent my thinking that you would like there to be
no one unhappy in the whole world when you are getting married....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3746">
Text = Yes,
brother, you must admit that you would like me, for instance, your best
friend, to come in for a fortune of a hundred thousand all of a sudden,
you would like all the enemies in the world to be suddenly, for no rhyme
or reason, reconciled, so that in their joy they might all embrace one
another in the middle of the street, and then, perhaps, come here to
call on you.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3747">
Text = Vasya, my dear boy, I am not laughing; it is true; you've
said as much to me long ago, in different ways.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3748">
Text = Because you are happy,
you want every one, absolutely every one, to become happy at once.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3749">
Text = It
hurts you and troubles you to be happy alone.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3750">
Text = And so you want at once to
do your utmost to be worthy of that happiness, and maybe to do some
great deed to satisfy your conscience.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3751">
Text = Oh!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3752">
Text = I understand how ready you
are to distress yourself for having suddenly been remiss just where you
ought to have shown your zeal, your capacity ... well, maybe your
gratitude, as you say.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3753">
Text = It is very bitter for you to think that Yulian
Mastakovitch may frown and even be angry when he sees that you have not
justified the expectations he had of you.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3754">
Text = It hurts you to think that you
may hear reproaches from the man you look upon as your benefactor--and
at such a moment! when your heart is full of joy and you don't know on
whom to lavish your gratitude....

<Sent id="3755">
Text = Isn't that true?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3756">
Text = It is, isn't it?"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3757">
Text = Arkady Ivanovitch, whose voice was trembling, paused, and drew a deep
breath.

<Sent id="3758">
Text = Vasya looked affectionately at his friend.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3759">
Text = A smile passed over his lips.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3760">
Text = His face even lighted up, as though with a gleam of hope.

"Well, listen, then," Arkady Ivanovitch began again, growing more
hopeful, "there's no necessity that you should forfeit Yulian
Mastakovitch's favour....

<Sent id="3761">
Text = Is there, dear boy?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3762">
Text = Is there any question of
it?

myself for you.

oppose me.

Mastakovitch is magnanimous and merciful, and, what is more, he is not
like you.

brother Vasya.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3768">
Text = Well, are you calmer?"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3769">
Text = Vasya pressed his friend's hands with tears in his eyes.

"Hush, hush, Arkady," he said, "the thing is settled.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3770">
Text = I haven't
finished, so very well; if I haven't finished, I haven't finished, and
there's no need for you to go.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3771">

myself.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3772">
Text = I am calmer now, I am perfectly calm; only you mustn't go....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3773">
Text = But listen...."

"Vasya, my dear boy," Arkady Ivanovitch cried joyfully, "I judged from
what you said.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3774">
Text = I am glad that you have thought better of things and have
recovered yourself.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3775">
Text = But whatever may befall you, whatever happens, I am
with you, remember that.

<Sent id="3776">
Text = I see that it worries you to think of my
speaking to Yulian Mastakovitch--and I won't say a word, not a word, you
shall tell him yourself.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3777">
Text = You see, you shall go to-morrow....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3778">
Text = Oh no, you
had better not go, you'll go on writing here, you see, and I'll find out
about this work, whether it is very urgent or not, whether it must be
done by the time or not, and if you don't finish it in time what will
come of it.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3779">
Text = Then I will run back to you.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3780">
Text = Do you see, do you see!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3781">
Text = There
is still hope; suppose the work is not urgent--it may be all right.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3782">
Text = Yulian Mastakovitch may not remember, then all is saved."
</Sent>
<Sent id="3783">
Text = Vasya shook his head doubtfully.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3784">
Text = But his grateful eyes never left his
friend's face.

"Come, that's enough, I am so weak, so tired," he said, sighing. "I
don't want to think about it.

Text = Let us talk of something else.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3786">
Text = I won't
write either now; do you know I'll only finish two short pages just to
get to the end of a passage.
</Sent>

Text = Listen ...

<Sent id="3788">
Text = I have long wanted to ask you,
how is it you know me so well?"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3789">
Text = Tears dropped from Vasya's eyes on Arkady's hand.

"If you knew, Vasya, how fond I am of you, you would not ask that--yes!"

"Yes, yes, Arkady, I don't know that, because I don't know why you are
so fond of me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3790">
Text = Yes, Arkady, do you know, even your love has been killing
me?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3791">
Text = Do you know, ever so many times, particularly when I am thinking of
you in bed (for I always think of you when I am falling asleep), I shed
tears, and my heart throbs at the thought ... at the thought....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3792">
Text = Well,
at the thought that you are so fond of me, while I can do nothing to
relieve my heart, can do nothing to repay you."

"You see, Vasya, you see what a fellow you are!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3793">
Text = Why, how upset you are
now," said Arkady, whose heart ached at that moment and who remembered
the scene in the street the day before.

"Nonsense, you want me to be calm, but I never have been so calm and
happy!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3794">
Text = Do you know....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3795">
Text = Listen, I want to tell you all about it, but I am
afraid of wounding you....

am afraid....

this is what I want to say.

before--yes!

yesterday.

<Sent id="3802">
Text = My heart
... was hard....

to any one, any one in the world, because I couldn't--I am not even
pleasant to look at....

</Sent>
<Sent id="3805">
Text = You, to begin with:
do you suppose I don't see that?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3806">
Text = Only I said nothing; only I said
nothing."

"Hush, Vasya!"

"Oh, Arkasha! ... it's all right," Vasya interrupted, hardly able to
articulate for tears. "I talked to you yesterday about Yulian
Mastakovitch.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3807">
Text = And you know yourself how stern and severe he is, even you
have come in for a reprimand from him; yet he deigned to jest with me
yesterday, to show his affection, and kind-heartedness, which he
prudently conceals from every one...."

"Come, Vasya, that only shows you deserve your good fortune."

"Oh, Arkasha!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3808">
Text = How I longed to finish all this....
</Sent>
<Sent id="3809">
Text = No, I shall ruin my
good luck!

</Sent>
<Sent id="3811">
Text = Oh no, not through that," Vasya added, seeing
that Arkady glanced at the heap of urgent work lying on the table,
"that's nothing, that's only paper covered with writing ... it's
nonsense!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3812">
Text = That matter's settled....

<Sent id="3813">
Text = I went to see them to-day, Arkasha;

<Sent id="3815">

dropping his voice, "I did not dare to go in."

"I say, Vasya--what is the matter with you?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3819">
Text = You look at one so
strangely."

"Oh, it's nothing, I feel a little sick; my legs are trembling; it's
because I sat up last night.

<Sent id="3820">
Text = Yes!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3821">
Text = Everything looks green before my eyes.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3822">
Text = It's here, here----"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3823">
Text = He pointed to his heart.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3824">
Text = He fainted.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3825">
Text = When he came to himself Arkady
tried to take forcible measures.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3826">
Text = He tried to compel him to go to bed.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3827">
Text = Nothing would induce Vasya to consent.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3828">
Text = He shed tears, wrung his hands,
wanted to write, was absolutely set on finishing his two pages.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3829">
Text = To avoid
exciting him Arkady let him sit down to the work.

"Do you know," said Vasya, as he settled himself in his place, "an idea
has occurred to me?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3830">
Text = There is hope."
</Sent>
<Sent id="3831">
Text = He smiled to Arkady, and his pale face lighted up with a gleam of hope.

"I will take him what is done the day after to-morrow.

will tell a lie.

in water, that I have lost it....

about it.

about my love; he has got married himself just lately, he'll understand
me.

tears and be touched by them...."

"Yes, of course, you must go, you must go and explain to him....

Text = But
there's no need of tears!

me."

"Yes, I'll go, I'll go.

</Sent>
<Sent id="3845">
Text = I
am not interfering with any one, let me write!"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3846">
Text = Arkady flung himself on the bed.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3847">
Text = He had no confidence in Vasya, no
confidence at all. "Vasya was capable of anything, but to ask
forgiveness for what? how?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3848">
Text = That was not the point.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3849">
Text = The point was, that
Vasya had not carried out his obligations, that Vasya felt guilty _in
his own eyes_, felt that he was ungrateful to destiny, that Vasya was
crushed, overwhelmed by happiness and thought himself unworthy of it;
that, in fact, he was simply trying to find an excuse to go off his head
on that point, and that he had not recovered from the unexpectedness of
what had happened the day before; that's what it is," thought Arkady
Ivanovitch. "I must save him.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3850">
Text = I must reconcile him to himself.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3851">
Text = He will
be his own ruin." He thought and thought, and resolved to go at once
next day to Yulian Mastakovitch, and to tell him all about it.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3852">
Text = Vasya was sitting writing.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3853">
Text = Arkady Ivanovitch, worn out, lay down to
think things over again, and only woke at daybreak.

"Damnation!

<Sent id="3854">
Text = Again!" he cried, looking at Vasya; the latter was still
sitting writing.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3855">
Text = Arkady rushed up to him, seized him and forcibly put him to bed.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3856">
Text = Vasya
was smiling: his eyes were closing with sleep.

Text = He could hardly speak.

"I wanted to go to bed," he said. "Do you know, Arkady, I have an idea;

<Sent id="3859">

longer; wake me at eight o'clock."
</Sent>
<Sent id="3861">

dead.

"Mavra," said Arkady Ivanovitch to Mavra, who came in with the tea, "he
asked to be waked in an hour.

sleep ten hours, if he can.

the office--do you understand?"

gentlemen should sleep well, and I take good care of their things.

wasn't me, it was poor pussy broke it, I ought to have kept an eye on
her. 'S-sh, you confounded thing,' I said."

"Hush, be quiet, be quiet!"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3868">

and locked her up there.

<Sent id="3869">
Text = Then he went to the office.

Text = On the way he
considered how he could present himself before Yulian Mastakovitch, and
whether it would be appropriate and not impertinent.

Text = He went into the
office timidly, and timidly inquired whether His Excellency were there;
receiving the answer that he was not and would not be, Arkady Ivanovitch
instantly thought of going to his flat, but reflected very prudently
that if Yulian Mastakovitch had not come to the office he would
certainly be busy at home.

knew anything about this.

Mastakovitch did employ him on special jobs, but what they were--no one
could say.

out, eager to get home.

Text = In the vestibule he was met by a clerk, who told
him that Vassily Petrovitch Shumkov had come about one o'clock and
asked, the clerk added, "whether you were here, and whether Yulian
Mastakovitch had been here." Hearing this Arkady Ivanovitch took a
sledge and hastened home beside himself with alarm.

himself, reflected, and hastened to conceal his emotion.

Text = He seemed to avoid his friend's questions,
seemed to be bothered by them, to be pondering to himself on some plan,
and deciding to conceal his decision, because he could not reckon
further on his friend's affection.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3883">
Text = This struck Arkady, and his heart
ached with a poignant and oppressive pain.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3884">
Text = He sat on the bed and began
turning over the leaves of some book, the only one he had in his
possession, keeping his eye on poor Vasya.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3885">
Text = But Vasya remained
obstinately silent, writing, and not raising his head.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3886">
Text = So passed several
hours, and Arkady's misery reached an extreme point.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3887">
Text = At last, at eleven
o'clock, Vasya lifted his head and looked with a fixed, vacant stare at
Arkady.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3888">
Text = Arkady waited.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3889">
Text = Two or three minutes passed;
</Sent>
<Sent id="3890">
Text = Vasya did not speak.

"Vasya!" cried Arkady.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3891">
Text = Vasya made no answer.

"Vasya!" he repeated, jumping up from the bed, "Vasya, what is the
matter with you?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3892">
Text = What is it?" he cried, running up to him.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3893">
Text = Vasya raised his eyes and again looked at him with the same vacant,
fixed stare.

"He's in a trance!" thought Arkady, trembling all over with fear.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3894">
Text = He
seized a bottle of water, raised Vasya, poured some water on his head,
moistened his temples, rubbed his hands in his own--and Vasya came to
himself. "Vasya, Vasya!" cried Arkady, unable to restrain his tears.
"Vasya, save yourself, rouse yourself, rouse yourself!..." He could say
no more, but held him tight in his arms.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3895">
Text = A look as of some oppressive
sensation passed over Vasya's face; he rubbed his forehead and clutched
at his head, as though he were afraid it would burst.

"I don't know what is the matter with me," he added, at last. "I feel
torn to pieces.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3896">
Text = Come, it's all right, it's all right!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3897">
Text = Give over, Arkady;
don't grieve," he repeated, looking at him with sad, exhausted eyes.
"Why be so anxious?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3898">
Text = Come!"

"You, you comforting me!" cried Arkady, whose heart was torn. "Vasya,"
he said at last, "lie down and have a little nap, won't you?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3899">
Text = Don't wear
yourself out for nothing!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3900">
Text = You'll set to work better afterwards."

"Yes, yes," said Vasya, "by all means, I'll lie down, very good.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3901">
Text = Yes!
you see I meant to finish, but now I've changed my mind, yes...."
</Sent>
<Sent id="3902">
Text = And Arkady led him to the bed.

"Listen, Vasya," he said firmly, "we must settle this matter finally.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3903">
Text = Tell me what were you thinking about?"

"Oh!" said Vasya, with a flourish of his weak hand turning over on the
other side.

"Come, Vasya, come, make up your mind.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3904">
Text = I don't want to hurt you.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3905">
Text = I can't
be silent any longer.

<Sent id="3906">
Text = You won't sleep till you've made up your mind, I
know."

"As you like, as you like," Vasya repeated enigmatically.

"He will give in," thought Arkady Ivanovitch.

"Attend to me, Vasya," he said, "remember what I say, and I will save
you to-morrow; to-morrow I will decide your fate!

<Sent id="3907">
Text = What am I saying, your
fate?

<Sent id="3908">

Yulian Mastakovitch's favour--affection, if you like.

lose it, you will see.

<Sent id="3915">
Text = Arkady Ivanovitch would have said more, but Vasya interrupted him.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3916">
Text = He
sat up in bed, put both arms round Arkady Ivanovitch's neck and kissed
him.

"Enough," he said in a weak voice, "enough!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3917">
Text = Say no more about that!"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3918">
Text = And again he turned his face to the wall.

"My goodness!" thought Arkady, "my goodness!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3919">
Text = What is the matter with
him?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3920">
Text = He is utterly lost.

</Sent>
<Sent id="3922">

undoing."

<Sent id="3923">
Text = Arkady looked at him in despair.

"If he were to fall ill," thought Arkady, "perhaps it would be better.

of settling the whole business.

<Sent id="3926">
Text = Oh, my
God!"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3927">
Text = Meanwhile Vasya seemed to be asleep.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3928">
Text = Arkady Ivanovitch was relieved. "A
good sign," he thought.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3929">
Text = He made up his mind to sit beside him all night.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3930">
Text = But Vasya was restless; he kept twitching and tossing about on the bed,
and opening his eyes for an instant.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3931">
Text = At last exhaustion got the upper
hand, he slept like the dead.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3932">
Text = It was about two o'clock in the morning,
Arkady Ivanovitch began to doze in the chair with his elbow on the
table!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3933">
Text = He had a strange and agitated dream.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3934">
Text = He kept fancying that he was not
asleep, and that Vasya was still lying on the bed.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3935">
Text = But strange to say,
he fancied that Vasya was pretending, that he was deceiving him, that he
was getting up, stealthily watching him out of the corner of his eye,
and was stealing up to the writing table.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3936">
Text = Arkady felt a scalding pain at
his heart; he felt vexed and sad and oppressed to see Vasya not trusting
him, hiding and concealing himself from him.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3937">
Text = He tried to catch hold of
him, to call out, to carry him to the bed.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3938">
Text = Then Vasya kept shrieking in
his arms, and he laid on the bed a lifeless corpse.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3939">
Text = He opened his eyes
and woke up;
</Sent>
<Sent id="3940">
Text = Vasya was sitting before him at the table, writing.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3941">
Text = Hardly able to believe his senses, Arkady glanced at the bed;
</Sent>
<Sent id="3942">
Text = Vasya was
not there.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3943">
Text = Arkady jumped up in a panic, still under the influence of his
dream.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3944">
Text = Vasya did not stir; he went on writing.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3945">
Text = All at once Arkady
noticed with horror that Vasya was moving a dry pen over the paper, was
turning over perfectly blank pages, and hurrying, hurrying to fill up
the paper as though he were doing his work in a most thorough and
efficient way. "No, this is not a trance," thought Arkady Ivanovitch,
and he trembled all over.

"Vasya, Vasya, speak to me," he cried, clutching him by the shoulder.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3946">
Text = But Vasya did not speak; he went on as before, scribbling with a dry pen
over the paper.

"At last I have made the pen go faster," he said, without looking up at
Arkady.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3947">
Text = Arkady seized his hand and snatched away the pen.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3948">
Text = A moan broke from Vasya.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3949">
Text = He dropped his hand and raised his eyes to
Arkady; then with an air of misery and exhaustion he passed his hand
over his forehead as though he wanted to shake off some leaden weight
that was pressing upon his whole being, and slowly, as though lost in
thought, he let his head sink on his breast.

"Vasya, Vasya!" cried Arkady in despair. "Vasya!"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3950">
Text = A minute later Vasya looked at him, tears stood in his large blue eyes,
and his pale, mild face wore a look of infinite suffering.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3951">
Text = He whispered
something.

"What, what is it?" cried Arkady, bending down to him.

"What for, why are they doing it to me?" whispered Vasya. "What for?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3952">
Text = What have I done?"

"Vasya, what is it?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3953">
Text = What are you afraid of?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3954">
Text = What is it?" cried Arkady,
wringing his hands in despair.

"Why are they sending me for a soldier?" said Vasya, looking his friend
straight in the face. "Why is it?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3955">
Text = What have I done?"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3956">
Text = Arkady's hair stood on end with horror; he refused to believe his ears.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3957">
Text = He stood over him, half dead.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3958">
Text = A minute later he pulled himself together. "It's nothing, it's only for
the minute," he said to himself, with pale face and blue, quivering
lips, and he hastened to put on his outdoor things.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3959">
Text = He meant to run
straight for a doctor.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3960">
Text = All at once Vasya called to him.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3961">
Text = Arkady rushed to
him and clasped him in his arms like a mother whose child is being torn
from her.

"Arkady, Arkady, don't tell any one!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3962">
Text = Don't tell any one, do you hear?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3963">
Text = It
is my trouble, I must bear it alone."

"What is it--what is it?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3964">
Text = Rouse yourself, Vasya, rouse yourself!"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3965">
Text = Vasya sighed, and slow tears trickled down his cheeks.

"Why kill her?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3966">
Text = How is she to blame?" he muttered in an agonized,
heartrending voice. "The sin is mine, the sin is mine!"
</Sent>
<Sent id="3967">
Text = He was silent for a moment.

"Farewell, my love!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3968">
Text = Farewell, my love!" he whispered, shaking his
luckless head.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3969">
Text = Arkady started, pulled himself together and would have
rushed for the doctor. "Let us go, it is time," cried Vasya, carried
away by Arkady's last movement. "Let us go, brother, let us go;
</Sent>
<Sent id="3970">
Text = I am
ready.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3971">
Text = You lead the way." He paused and looked at Arkady with a downcast
and mistrustful face.

"Vasya, for goodness' sake, don't follow me!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3972">
Text = Wait for me here.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3973">
Text = I will
come back to you directly, directly," said Arkady Ivanovitch, losing his
head and snatching up his cap to run for a doctor.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3974">
Text = Vasya sat down at
once, he was quiet and docile; but there was a gleam of some desperate
resolution in his eye.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3975">
Text = Arkady turned back, snatched up from the table an
open penknife, looked at the poor fellow for the last time, and ran out
of the flat.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3976">
Text = It was eight o'clock.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3977">
Text = It had been broad daylight for some time in the
room.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3978">
Text = He found no one.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3979">
Text = He was running about for a full hour.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3980">
Text = All the doctors
whose addresses he had got from the house porter when he inquired of the
latter whether there were no doctor living in the building, had gone
out, either to their work or on their private affairs.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3981">
Text = There was one who
saw patients.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3982">
Text = This one questioned at length and in detail the servant
who announced that Nefedevitch had called, asking him who it was, from
whom he came, what was the matter, and concluded by saying that he could
not go, that he had a great deal to do, and that patients of that kind
ought to be taken to a hospital.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3983">
Text = Then Arkady, exhausted, agitated, and utterly taken aback by this turn
of affairs, cursed all the doctors on earth, and rushed home in the
utmost alarm about Vasya.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3984">
Text = He ran into the flat.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3985">
Text = Mavra, as though there
were nothing the matter, went on scrubbing the floor, breaking up wood
and preparing to light the stove.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3986">
Text = He went into the room; there was no
trace of Vasya, he had gone out.

"Which way?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3987">
Text = Where?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3988">
Text = Where will the poor fellow be off to?" thought
Arkady, frozen with terror.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3989">
Text = He began questioning Mavra.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3990">
Text = She knew
nothing, had neither seen nor heard him go out, God bless him!
</Sent>
<Sent id="3991">
Text = Nefedevitch rushed off to the Artemyevs'.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3992">
Text = It occurred to him for some reason that he must be there.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3993">
Text = It was ten o'clock by the time he arrived.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3994">
Text = They did not expect him, knew
nothing and had heard nothing.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3995">
Text = He stood before them frightened,
distressed, and asked where was Vasya?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3996">
Text = The mother's legs gave way under
her; she sank back on the sofa.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3997">
Text = Lizanka, trembling with alarm, began
asking what had happened.
</Sent>
<Sent id="3998">
Text = What could he say?
</Sent>
<Sent id="3999">
Text = Arkady Ivanovitch got out
of it as best he could, invented some tale which of course was not
believed, and fled, leaving them distressed and anxious.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4000">
Text = He flew to his
department that he might not be too late there, and he let them know
that steps might be taken at once.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4001">
Text = On the way it occurred to him that
Vasya would be at Yulian Mastakovitch's. That was more likely than
anything: Arkady had thought of that first of all, even before the
Artemyevs'.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4002">
Text = As he drove by His Excellency's door, he thought of
stopping, but at once told the driver to go straight on.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4003">
Text = He made up his
mind to try and find out whether anything had happened at the office,
and if he were not there to go to His Excellency, ostensibly to report
on Vasya.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4004">
Text = Some one must be informed of it.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4005">
Text = As soon as he got into the waiting-room he was surrounded by
fellow-clerks, for the most part young men of his own standing in the
service.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4006">
Text = With one voice they began asking him what had happened to
Vasya?
</Sent>
<Sent id="4007">
Text = At the same time they all told him that Vasya had gone out of his
mind, and thought that he was to be sent for a soldier as a punishment
for having neglected his work.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4008">
Text = Arkady Ivanovitch, answering them in all
directions, or rather avoiding giving a direct answer to any one, rushed
into the inner room.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4009">
Text = On the way he learned that Vasya was in Yulian
Mastakovitch's private room, that every one had been there and that
Esper Ivanovitch had gone in there too.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4010">
Text = He was stopped on the way.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4011">
Text = One
of the senior clerks asked him who he was and what he wanted?
</Sent>
<Sent id="4012">
Text = Without
distinguishing the person he said something about Vasya and went
straight into the room.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4013">
Text = He heard Yulian Mastakovitch's voice from
within. "Where are you going?" some one asked him at the very door.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4014">
Text = Arkady Ivanovitch was almost in despair; he was on the point of turning
back, but through the open door he saw his poor Vasya.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4015">
Text = He pushed the
door and squeezed his way into the room.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4016">
Text = Every one seemed to be in
confusion and perplexity, because Yulian Mastakovitch was apparently
much chagrined.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4017">
Text = All the more important personages were standing about
him talking, and coming to no decision.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4018">
Text = At a little distance stood
Vasya.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4019">
Text = Arkady's heart sank when he looked at him.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4020">
Text = Vasya was standing,
pale, with his head up, stiffly erect, like a recruit before a new
officer, with his feet together and his hands held rigidly at his sides.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4021">
Text = He was looking Yulian Mastakovitch straight in the face.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4022">
Text = Arkady was
noticed at once, and some one who knew that they lodged together
mentioned the fact to His Excellency.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4023">
Text = Arkady was led up to him.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4024">
Text = He tried
to make some answer to the questions put to him, glanced at Yulian
Mastakovitch and seeing on his face a look of genuine compassion, began
trembling and sobbing like a child.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4025">
Text = He even did more, he snatched His
Excellency's hand and held it to his eyes, wetting it with his tears, so
that Yulian Mastakovitch was obliged to draw it hastily away, and waving
it in the air, said, "Come, my dear fellow, come!
</Sent>
<Sent id="4026">
Text = I see you have a good
heart." Arkady sobbed and turned an imploring look on every one.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4027">
Text = It
seemed to him that they were all brothers of his dear Vasya, that they
were all worried and weeping about him. "How, how has it happened? how
has it happened?" asked Yulian Mastakovitch. "What has sent him out of
his mind?"

"Gra--gra--gratitude!" was all Arkady Ivanovitch could articulate.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4028">
Text = Every one heard his answer with amazement, and it seemed strange and
incredible to every one that a man could go out of his mind from
gratitude.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4029">
Text = Arkady explained as best he could.

"Good Heavens! what a pity!" said Yulian Mastakovitch at last. "And the
work entrusted to him was not important, and not urgent in the least.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4030">
Text = It
was not worth while for a man to kill himself over it!
</Sent>
<Sent id="4031">
Text = Well, take him
away!"...
</Sent>
<Sent id="4032">
Text = At this point Yulian Mastakovitch turned to Arkady Ivanovitch
again, and began questioning him once more. "He begs," he said, pointing
to Vasya, "that some girl should not be told of this.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4033">
Text = Who is she--his
betrothed, I suppose?"
</Sent>
<Sent id="4034">
Text = Arkady began to explain.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4035">
Text = Meanwhile Vasya seemed to be thinking of
something, as though he were straining his memory to the utmost to
recall some important, necessary matter, which was particularly wanted
at this moment.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4036">
Text = From time to time he looked round with a distressed
face, as though hoping some one would remind him of what he had
forgotten.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4037">
Text = He fastened his eyes on Arkady.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4038">
Text = All of a sudden there was a
gleam of hope in his eyes; he moved with the left leg forward, took
three steps as smartly as he could, clicking with his right boot as
soldiers do when they move forward at the call from their officer.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4039">
Text = Every
one was waiting to see what would happen.

"I have a physical defect and am small and weak, and I am not fit for
military service, Your Excellency," he said abruptly.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4040">
Text = At that every one in the room felt a pang at his heart, and firm as was
Yulian Mastakovitch's character, tears trickled from his eyes.

"Take him away," he said, with a wave of his hands.

"Present!" said Vasya in an undertone; he wheeled round to the left and
marched out of the room.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4041">
Text = All who were interested in his fate followed
him out.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4042">
Text = Arkady pushed his way out behind the others.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4043">
Text = They made Vasya
sit down in the waiting-room till the carriage came which had been
ordered to take him to the hospital.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4044">
Text = He sat down in silence and seemed
in great anxiety.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4045">
Text = He nodded to any one he recognized as though saying
good-bye.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4046">
Text = He looked round towards the door every minute, and prepared
himself to set off when he should be told it was time.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4047">
Text = People crowded in
a close circle round him; they were all shaking their heads and
lamenting.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4048">
Text = Many of them were much impressed by his story, which had
suddenly become known.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4049">
Text = Some discussed his illness, while others
expressed their pity and high opinion of Vasya, saying that he was such
a quiet, modest young man, that he had been so promising; people
described what efforts he had made to learn, how eager he was for
knowledge, how he had worked to educate himself. "He had risen by his
own efforts from a humble position," some one observed.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4050">
Text = They spoke with
emotion of His Excellency's affection for him.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4051">
Text = Some of them fell to
explaining why Vasya was possessed by the idea that he was being sent
for a soldier, because he had not finished his work.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4052">
Text = They said that the
poor fellow had so lately belonged to the class liable for military
service and had only received his first grade through the good offices
of Yulian Mastakovitch, who had had the cleverness to discover his
talent, his docility, and the rare mildness of his disposition.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4053">
Text = In fact,
there was a great number of views and theories.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4054">
Text = A very short fellow-clerk of Vasya's was conspicuous as being
particularly distressed.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4055">
Text = He was not very young, probably about thirty.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4056">
Text = He was pale as a sheet, trembling all over and smiling queerly, perhaps
because any scandalous affair or terrible scene both frightens, and at
the same time somewhat rejoices the outside spectator.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4057">
Text = He kept running
round the circle that surrounded Vasya, and as he was so short, stood on
tiptoe and caught at the button of every one--that is, of those with
whom he felt entitled to take such a liberty--and kept saying that he
knew how it had all happened, that it was not so simple, but a very
important matter, that it couldn't be left without further inquiry; then
stood on tiptoe again, whispered in some one's ear, nodded his head
again two or three times, and ran round again.

<Sent id="4058">

over.

went up to Vasya and told him it was time to start.

<Sent id="4104">
Text = Just
five years ago, on New Year's Eve, I was invited to a children's party.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4105">
Text = The giver of the party was a well-known and business-like personage,
with connections, with a large circle of acquaintances, and a good many
schemes on hand, so that it may be supposed that this party was an
excuse for getting the parents together and discussing various
interesting matters in an innocent, casual way.

no interesting matter to contribute, and so I spent the evening rather
independently.

of no special rank or family, and who, like me, had simply turned up at
this family festivity.

<Sent id="4110">
Text = He was a tall,
lanky man, very grave and very correctly dressed.

Text = But one could see that
he was in no mood for merrymaking and family festivity; whenever he
withdrew into a corner he left off smiling and knitted his bushy black
brows.

<Sent id="4112">
Text = He had not a single acquaintance in the party except his host.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4113">
Text = One could see that he was fearfully bored, but that he was valiantly
keeping up the part of a man perfectly happy and enjoying himself.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4114">
Text = I
learned afterwards that this was a gentleman from the provinces, who had
a critical and perplexing piece of business in Petersburg, who had
brought a letter of introduction to our host, for whom our host was, by
no means _con amore_, using his interest, and whom he had invited, out
of civility, to his children's party.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4115">
Text = He did not play cards, cigars were
not offered him, every one avoided entering into conversation with him,
most likely recognizing the bird from its feathers; and so my gentleman
was forced to sit the whole evening stroking his whiskers simply to have
something to do with his hands.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4116">
Text = His whiskers were certainly very fine.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4117">
Text = But he stroked them so zealously that, looking at him, one might have
supposed that the whiskers were created first and the gentleman only
attached to them in order to stroke them.

family festivity (he had five fat, well-fed boys), I was attracted, too,
by another gentleman.

personage.

could see that he was an honoured guest, and stood in the same relation
to our host as our host stood in relation to the gentleman who was
stroking his whiskers.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4123">
Text = Our host and hostess said no end of polite things
to him, waited on him hand and foot, pressed him to drink, flattered
him, brought their visitors up to be introduced to him, but did not take
him to be introduced to any one else.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4124">
Text = I noticed that tears glistened in
our host's eyes when he remarked about the party that he had rarely
spent an evening so agreeably.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4125">
Text = I felt as it were frightened in the
presence of such a personage, and so, after admiring the children, I
went away into a little parlour, which was quite empty, and sat down in
an arbour of flowers which filled up almost half the room.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4126">
Text = The children were all incredibly sweet, and resolutely refused to model
themselves on the "grown-ups," regardless of all the admonitions of
their governesses and mammas.

last sweetmeat in the twinkling of an eye, and had succeeded in breaking
half the playthings before they knew what was destined for which.

trying to shoot me with his wooden gun.

attracted by his sister, a girl of eleven, quiet, dreamy, pale, with
big, prominent, dreamy eyes, exquisite as a little Cupid.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4130">
Text = The children
hurt her feelings in some way, and so she came away from them to the
same empty parlour in which I was sitting, and played with her doll in
the corner.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4131">
Text = The visitors respectfully pointed out her father, a wealthy
contractor, and some one whispered that three hundred thousand roubles
were already set aside for her dowry.

Text = I turned round to glance at the
group who were interested in such a circumstance, and my eye fell on
Yulian Mastakovitch, who, with his hands behind his back and his head on
one side, was listening with the greatest attention to these gentlemen's
idle gossip.

<Sent id="4133">
Text = Afterwards I could not help admiring the discrimination of
the host and hostess in the distribution of the children's presents.

little girl, who had already a portion of three hundred thousand
roubles, received the costliest doll.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4135">
Text = Then followed presents diminishing
in value in accordance with the rank of the parents of these happy
children; finally, the child of lowest degree, a thin, freckled,
red-haired little boy of ten, got nothing but a book of stories about
the marvels of nature and tears of devotion, etc., without pictures or
even woodcuts.

children of the house, an oppressed and scared little boy.

dressed in a short jacket of inferior nankin.

he walked round the other toys for a long time; he longed to play with
the other children, but did not dare; it was evident that he already
felt and understood his position.

Text = I love watching children.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4140">

independent approaches to life are extremely interesting.

<Sent id="4141">

the red-haired boy was so fascinated by the costly toys of the other
children, especially by a theatre in which he certainly longed to take
some part, that he made up his mind to sacrifice his dignity.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4142">
Text = He smiled
and began playing with the other children, he gave away his apple to a
fat-faced little boy who had a mass of goodies tied up in a
pocket-handkerchief already, and even brought himself to carry another
boy on his back, simply not to be turned away from the theatre, but an
insolent youth gave him a heavy thump a minute later.

dare to cry.

told him not to interfere with the other children's playing.

went away to the same room in which was the little girl.

join her, and the two set to work very eagerly dressing the expensive
doll.

to the little prattle of the red-haired boy and the beauty with the
dowry of three hundred thousand, who was nursing her doll, when Yulian
Mastakovitch suddenly walked into the room.

the general commotion following a quarrel among the children to step out
of the drawing-room.

cordially to the future heiress's papa, whose acquaintance he had just
made, of the superiority of one branch of the service over another.

he stood in hesitation and seemed to be reckoning something on his
fingers.

"Three hundred ... three hundred," he was whispering. "Eleven ... twelve
... thirteen," and so on. "Sixteen--five years!

stick to four per cent., the rascal.

hundred, let us say, five hundred at least ... that's certain; well, say
a little more for frills.

</Sent>
<Sent id="4157">
Text = His hesitation was at an end, he blew his nose and was on the point of
going out of the room when he suddenly glanced at the little girl and
stopped short.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4158">
Text = He did not see me behind the pots of greenery.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4159">
Text = It seemed
to me that he was greatly excited.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4160">
Text = Either his calculations had affected
his imagination or something else, for he rubbed his hands and could
hardly stand still.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4161">
Text = This excitement reached its utmost limit when he
stopped and bent another resolute glance at the future heiress.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4162">
Text = He was
about to move forward, but first looked round, then moving on tiptoe, as
though he felt guilty, he advanced towards the children.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4163">
Text = He approached
with a little smile, bent down and kissed her on the head.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4164">
Text = The child,
not expecting this attack, uttered a cry of alarm.

"What are you doing here, sweet child?" he asked in a whisper, looking
round and patting the girl's cheek.

"We are playing."

"Ah!
</Sent>
<Sent id="4165">
Text = With him?" Yulian Mastakovitch looked askance at the boy. "You had
better go into the drawing-room, my dear," he said to him.

<Sent id="4166">
Text = The boy looked at him open-eyed and did not utter a word.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4167">
Text = Yulian
Mastakovitch looked round him again, and again bent down to the little
girl.

"And what is this you've got--a dolly, dear child?" he asked.

"Yes, a dolly," answered the child, frowning, and a little shy.

"A dolly ... and do you know, dear child, what your dolly is made of?"

"I don't know ..." the child answered in a whisper, hanging her head.

"It's made of rags, darling.

<Sent id="4168">

your playmates, boy," said Yulian Mastakovitch, looking sternly at the
boy.

</Sent>
<Sent id="4170">
Text = They did not
want to be separated.

"And do you know why they gave you that doll?" asked Yulian
Mastakovitch, dropping his voice to a softer and softer tone.

"I don't know."

"Because you have been a sweet and well-behaved child all the week."
</Sent>
<Sent id="4171">
Text = At this point Yulian Mastakovitch, more excited than ever, speaking in
most dulcet tones, asked at last, in a hardly audible voice choked with
emotion and impatience--

"And will you love me, dear little girl, when I come and see your papa
and mamma?"
</Sent>
<Sent id="4172">
Text = Saying this, Yulian Mastakovitch tried once more to kiss "the dear
little girl," but the red-haired boy, seeing that the little girl was on
the point of tears, clutched her hand and began whimpering from sympathy
for her.

<Sent id="4173">
Text = Yulian Mastakovitch was angry in earnest.

"Go away, go away from here, go away!" he said to the boy. "Go into the
drawing-room!

"No, he needn't, he needn't!

him alone, leave him alone," she said, almost crying.

<Sent id="4177">
Text = Yulian Mastakovitch instantly raised
his majestic person and took alarm.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4178">

alarmed than Yulian Mastakovitch; he abandoned the little girl and,
slinking along by the wall, stole out of the parlour into the
dining-room.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4179">
Text = To avoid arousing suspicion, Yulian Mastakovitch, too, went
into the dining-room.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4180">
Text = He was as red as a lobster, and, glancing into the
looking-glass, seemed to be ashamed at himself.

with himself for his impetuosity and hastiness.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4182">
Text = Possibly, he was at
first so much impressed by his calculations, so inspired and fascinated
by them, that in spite of his seriousness and dignity he made up his
mind to behave like a boy, and directly approach the object of his
attentions, even though she could not be really the object of his
attentions for another five years at least.

gentleman into the dining-room and there beheld a strange spectacle.

handkerchief and began flicking it under the table at the child, who
kept perfectly quiet.

little inclined to be fat.

paunchy, with thick legs; what is called a fine figure of a man, round
as a nut.

knew something of life, and looked at it from a serious point of view,
he at once availed himself of the chance of catching his visitor by
himself.

"Here, this is the boy," he said, pointing to the red-haired boy, "for
whom I had the honour to solicit your influence."

"Ah!" said Yulian Mastakovitch, who had hardly quite recovered himself.

"The son of my children's governess," said our host, in a tone of a
petitioner, "a poor woman, the widow of an honest civil servant; and
therefore ... and therefore, Yulian Mastakovitch, if it were possible
..."

"Oh, no, no!" Yulian Mastakovitch made haste to answer; "no, excuse me,

reach my ear, asked who was that strange young man?

afterwards the mamma of the interesting child, deeply touched, beg
Yulian Mastakovitch, in carefully chosen phrases, to do her the special
honour of bestowing upon them the precious gift of his acquaintance, and

invitation, and how afterwards the guests, dispersing in different
directions, moving away with the greatest propriety, poured out to one
another the most touchingly flattering comments upon the contractor, his
wife, his little girl, and, above all, upon Yulian Mastakovitch.

who could scarcely have reached her first season.

pale and melancholy.

eyes were red with recent weeping.

of her face gave a certain dignity and seriousness to her beauty.

through that sternness and dignity, through that melancholy, could be
seen the look of childish innocence; something indescribably naïve,
fluid, youthful, which seemed mutely begging for mercy.

</Sent>
<Sent id="4241">
Text = I began to scrutinize the man closely.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4242">
Text = Even in his exterior there was
something so peculiar that it compelled one, however far away one's
thoughts might be, to fix one's eyes upon him and go off into the most
irrepressible roar of laughter.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4243">
Text = That is what happened to me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4244">
Text = I must
observe that the little man's eyes were so mobile, or perhaps he was so
sensitive to the magnetism of every eye fixed upon him, that he almost
by instinct guessed that he was being observed, turned at once to the
observer and anxiously analysed his expression.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4245">
Text = His continual mobility,
his turning and twisting, made him look strikingly like a dancing doll.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4246">
Text = It was strange!
</Sent>
<Sent id="4247">
Text = He seemed afraid of jeers, in spite of the fact that he
was almost getting his living by being a buffoon for all the world, and
exposed himself to every buffet in a moral sense and even in a physical
one, judging from the company he was in.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4248">
Text = Voluntary buffoons are not even
to be pitied.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4249">

ridiculous man, was by no means a buffoon by profession.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4250">
Text = There was still
something gentlemanly in him.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4251">
Text = His very uneasiness, his continual
apprehensiveness about himself, were actually a testimony in his favour.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4252">
Text = It seemed to me that his desire to be obliging was due more to kindness
of heart than to mercenary considerations.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4253">
Text = He readily allowed them to
laugh their loudest at him and in the most unseemly way, to his face,
but at the same time--and I am ready to take my oath on it--his heart
ached and was sore at the thought that his listeners were so caddishly
brutal as to be capable of laughing, not at anything said or done, but
at him, at his whole being, at his heart, at his head, at his
appearance, at his whole body, flesh and blood.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4254">
Text = I am convinced that he
felt at that moment all the foolishness of his position; but the protest
died away in his heart at once, though it invariably sprang up again in
the most heroic way.

<Sent id="4255">
Text = I am convinced that all this was due to nothing
else but a kind heart, and not to fear of the inconvenience of being
kicked out and being unable to borrow money from some one.

gentleman was for ever borrowing money, that is, he asked for alms in
that form, when after playing the fool and entertaining them at his
expense he felt in a certain sense entitled to borrow money from them.

countenance he asked for the loan!

such a small space as the wrinkled, angular face of that little man room
could be found, at one and the same time, for so many different
grimaces, for such strange, variously characteristic shades of feeling,
such absolutely killing expressions.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4260">
Text = Everything was there--shame and an
assumption of insolence, and vexation at the sudden flushing of his
face, and anger and fear of failure, and entreaty to be forgiven for
having dared to pester, and a sense of his own dignity, and a still
greater sense of his own abjectness--all this passed over his face like
lightning.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4261">
Text = For six whole years he had struggled along in God's world in
this way, and so far had been unable to take up a fitting attitude at
the interesting moment of borrowing money!

<Sent id="4262">
Text = I need not say that he never
could grow callous and completely abject.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4263">
Text = His heart was too sensitive,
too passionate!
</Sent>
<Sent id="4264">
Text = I will say more, indeed: in my opinion, he was one of
the most honest and honourable men in the world, but with a little
weakness: of being ready to do anything abject at any one's bidding,
good-naturedly and disinterestedly, simply to oblige a fellow-creature.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4265">
Text = In short, he was what is called "a rag" in the fullest sense of the
word.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4266">
Text = The most absurd thing was, that he was dressed like any one else,
neither worse nor better, tidily, even with a certain elaborateness, and
actually had pretentions to respectability and personal dignity.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4267">
Text = This
external equality and internal inequality, his uneasiness about himself
and at the same time his continual self-depreciation--all this was
strikingly incongruous and provocative of laughter and pity.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4268">
Text = If he had
been convinced in his heart (and in spite of his experience it did
happen to him at moments to believe this) that his audience were the
most good-natured people in the world, who were simply laughing at
something amusing, and not at the sacrifice of his personal dignity, he
would most readily have taken off his coat, put it on wrong side
outwards, and have walked about the streets in that attire for the
diversion of others and his own gratification.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4269">
Text = But equality he could
never anyhow attain.

<Sent id="4270">
Text = Another trait: the queer fellow was proud, and
even, by fits and starts, when it was not too risky, generous.

worth seeing and hearing how he could sometimes, not sparing himself,
consequently with pluck, almost with heroism, dispose of one of his
patrons who had infuriated him to madness.

useless and consequently the most comic martyr.

in a husky voice, dropping his hand into his coat pocket and, as though

"Whatever happened to you?" asked an officer.

"What do you suppose?" asked Polzunkov, turning promptly, with a
convulsively working face, to the young man with ringlets. "Well,
gentlemen, a strange circumstance occurred, though indeed there was
nothing strange in it: it was what is called an everyday affair--I
simply took out of my pocket a roll of paper ... and he a roll of
paper."

"Paper notes?"

"Paper notes; and we exchanged."

"I don't mind betting that there's a flavour of bribery about it,"
observed a respectably dressed, closely cropped young gentleman.

"Bribery!" Polzunkov caught him up.

lights which made our ladies, who were almost every one of them pretty
at all times, seem still more charming, with their faces excited by the
impressions of the day, with their sparkling eyes, with their
interchange of spritely conversation, their peals of ringing laughter;
dancing, music, singing; if the sky were overcast tableaux vivants,
charades, proverbs were arranged, private theatricals were got up.

looked everywhere, but all the chairs are taken," I added, as though
complaining to her that all the chairs were taken.

closer and closer to that friend's heart in every step in life.

smile, turning his lorgnette upon me.

straight in his face I jumped down the three steps of the verandah at
one bound.

absurd curiosity.

such brilliance, such wit.

under the most harum-scarum wilfulness, the most schoolboyish pranks,
almost verging on buffoonery; they were rarely noticed, and, when they

was accompanied by an eager whisper of amazement among all.

regular cross-fire of witticisms, of mocking and sarcastic sallies, of
that most illusive and treacherous kind that, smoothly wrapped up on the
surface, hit the mark without giving the victim anything to lay hold of,

to fury and comic despair.

resourcefulness not to be completely covered with ignominy.

utmost to stop her indiscreet friend, who was certainly trying to depict
the jealous husband in the most grotesque and absurd guise, in the guise
of "a bluebeard" it must be supposed, judging from all probabilities,
from what has remained in my memory and finally from the part which I
myself was destined to play in the affair.

minute.

I guessed that mine was not the most unpleasant part in the performance,

broken with tears and indignation:

well of his own horsemanship, and stood, without mounting his horse,
impatiently rubbing his hands and continually glancing towards the door;
some similar feeling seemed shared by the two stable-boys, who were

before the whole company in charge of a horse which might any minute
kill a man for no reason whatever.

his eyes and looked at the frightened ladies.

"A very fine horse!" he said, as though to himself, "and to my thinking
it ought to be a great pleasure to ride him; but ... but do you know, I
think I won't go?" he concluded, turning to our host with the broad,
good-natured smile which so suited his kind and clever face.

"Yet I consider you are an excellent horseman, I assure you," answered
the owner of the unapproachable horse, delighted, and he warmly and even
gratefully pressed the young man's hand, "just because from the first
moment you saw the sort of brute you had to deal with," he added with
dignity. "Would you believe me, though I have served twenty-three years
in the hussars, yet I've had the pleasure of being laid on the ground
three times, thanks to that beast, that is, as often as I mounted the
useless animal.

simply ate corn for nothing; moreover, the old hussar had lost his
reputation for a knowledge of horseflesh by paying a fabulous sum for
the worthless beast, which he had purchased only for his beauty ... yet
he was delighted now that Tancred had kept up his reputation, had
disposed of another rider, and so had drawn closer on himself fresh
senseless laurels.

"So you are not going?" cried the blonde beauty, who was particularly
anxious that her _cavaliere servente_ should be in attendance on this
occasion. "Surely you are not frightened?"

"Upon my word I am," answered the young man.

revenge myself on all of them and before everyone, by showing the sort

proud soul more sweetly than victory and fame--I don't know whether all

the tears scalded my cheeks. "Well, you shall see!" And clutching at
Tancred's mane I put my foot in the stirrup before they had time to make
a movement to stop me; but at that instant Tancred reared, jerked his

followed her mechanically, never losing sight of her, though I trembled

Text = At last she came out on the
little path that led to the house.

Text = After waiting half a minute I, too,
emerged from the bushes; but what was my amazement when I saw lying on
the red sand of the path a sealed packet, which I recognized, from the
first glance, as the one that had been given to Mme.

<Sent id="4994">
Text = M. ten minutes
before.

<Sent id="4995">
Text = I picked it up.
</Sent>
<Sent id="4996">
Text = On both sides the paper was blank, there was no address
on it.

<Sent id="4997">
Text = The envelope was not large, but it was fat and heavy, as though
there were three or more sheets of notepaper in it.

<Sent id="4998">
Text = What was the meaning of this envelope?
</Sent>
<Sent id="4999">
Text = No doubt it would explain the
whole mystery.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5000">
Text = Perhaps in it there was said all that N. had scarcely
hoped to express in their brief, hurried interview.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5001">
Text = He had not even
dismounted....

<Sent id="5002">
Text = Whether he had been in haste or whether he had been
afraid of being false to himself at the hour of parting--God only
knows....
</Sent>
<Sent id="5003">
Text = I stopped, without coming out on the path, threw the envelope in the
most conspicuous place on it, and kept my eyes upon it, supposing that
Mme.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5004">
Text = M. would notice the loss and come back and look for it.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5005">
Text = But after
waiting four minutes I could stand it no longer, I picked up my find
again, put it in my pocket, and set off to overtake Mme.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5006">
Text = M. I came upon
her in the big avenue in the garden.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5007">

the house with a swift and hurried step, though she was lost in thought,
and her eyes were on the ground.

<Sent id="5008">
Text = I did not know what to do.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5009">
Text = Go up to
her, give it her?

everything, that I had seen it all.

word.

expecting that she would discover her loss and return on her tracks.

would have found it.

Text = We were approaching the house; she had
already been noticed....
</Sent>
<Sent id="5018">

because, after the unsuccessful expedition of the evening before, they
had arranged something new, of which I had heard nothing.

preparing to set off, and were having breakfast in the verandah.

waited for ten minutes, that I might not be seen with Mme.

<Sent id="5021">
Text = M., and
making a circuit of the garden approached the house from the other side
a long time after her.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5022">
Text = She was walking up and down the verandah with her
arms folded, looking pale and agitated, and was obviously trying her
utmost to suppress the agonizing, despairing misery which could be
plainly discerned in her eyes, her walk, her every movement.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5023">
Text = Sometimes
she went down the verandah steps and walked a few paces among the
flower-beds in the direction of the garden; her eyes were impatiently,
greedily, even incautiously, seeking something on the sand of the path
and on the floor of the verandah.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5024">
Text = There could be no doubt she had
discovered her loss and imagined she had dropped the letter somewhere
here, near the house--yes, that must be so, she was convinced of it.

same remark.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5026">

condolences.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5027">
Text = She had to laugh, to jest, to appear lively.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5028">
Text = From time to
time she looked at her husband, who was standing at the end of the
terrace talking to two ladies, and the poor woman was overcome by the
same shudder, the same embarrassment, as on the day of his first
arrival.

<Sent id="5029">
Text = Thrusting my hand into my pocket and holding the letter tight
in it, I stood at a little distance from them all, praying to fate that
Mme.

anxiety if only by a glance; to say a word to her on the sly.

she did chance to look at me I dropped my eyes.

secret.

Text = The intrigue was not such, perhaps, as one might suppose at the first
glance.

<Sent id="5037">
Text = Perhaps that kiss was the kiss of farewell, perhaps it was the
last slight reward for the sacrifice made to her peace and honour.

<Sent id="5038">
Text = N.
was going away, he was leaving her, perhaps for ever.

was holding in my hand--who can tell what it contained!

judge? and who can condemn?

discovery of her secret would have been terrible--would have been a
fatal blow for her.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5042">
Text = I still remember her face at that minute, it could
not have shown more suffering.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5043">
Text = To feel, to know, to be convinced, to
expect, as though it were one's execution, that in a quarter of an hour,
in a minute perhaps, all might be discovered, the letter might be found
by some one, picked up; there was no address on it, it might be opened,
and then....

<Sent id="5044">
Text = What then?
</Sent>
<Sent id="5045">
Text = What torture could be worse than what was
awaiting her?
</Sent>
<Sent id="5046">

</Sent>
<Sent id="5047">
Text = In
another minute their smiling flattering faces would be menacing and
merciless.

faces, and then her life would be plunged in everlasting darkness, with
no dawn to follow....
</Sent>
<Sent id="5049">
Text = Yes, I did not understand it then as I understand
it now.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5050">

heart-ache at the thought of her danger, which I could not fully
understand.
</Sent>

expiation were needed, by those moments of anguish of which I was
witness and which I shall never forget.

bustling about gaily; laughter and lively chatter were heard on all
sides.

join the party, acknowledging at last that she was not well.

God, all the others set off, every one was in haste, and there was no
time to worry her with commiseration, inquiries, and advice.

remained at home.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5058">
Text = Her husband said a few words to her; she answered that
she would be all right directly, that he need not be uneasy, that there
was no occasion for her to lie down, that she would go into the garden,
alone ... with me ... here she glanced at me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5059">
Text = Nothing could be more
fortunate!
</Sent>
<Sent id="5060">
Text = I flushed with pleasure, with delight; a minute later we were
on the way.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5061">
Text = She walked along the same avenues and paths by which she had returned
from the copse, instinctively remembering the way she had come, gazing
before her with her eyes fixed on the ground, looking about intently
without answering me, possibly forgetting that I was walking beside her.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5062">
Text = But when we had already reached the place where I had picked up the
letter, and the path ended, Mme.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5063">
Text = M. suddenly stopped, and in a voice
faint and weak with misery said that she felt worse, and that she would
go home.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5064">
Text = But when she reached the garden fence she stopped again and
thought a minute; a smile of despair came on her lips, and utterly worn
out and exhausted, resigned, and making up her mind to the worst, she
turned without a word and retraced her steps, even forgetting to tell me
of her intention.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5065">
Text = My heart was torn with sympathy, and I did not know what to do.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5066">
Text = We went, or rather I led her, to the place from which an hour before I
had heard the tramp of a horse and their conversation.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5067">
Text = Here, close to a
shady elm tree, was a seat hewn out of one huge stone, about which grew
ivy, wild jasmine, and dog-rose; the whole wood was dotted with little
bridges, arbours, grottoes, and similar surprises.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5068">
Text = Mme.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5069">
Text = M. sat down on
the bench and glanced unconsciously at the marvellous view that lay open
before us.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5070">
Text = A minute later she opened her book, and fixed her eyes upon
it without reading, without turning the pages, almost unconscious of
what she was doing.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5071">
Text = It was about half-past nine.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5072">
Text = The sun was already
high and was floating gloriously in the deep, dark blue sky, as though
melting away in its own light.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5073">
Text = The mowers were by now far away; they
were scarcely visible from our side of the river; endless ridges of mown
grass crept after them in unbroken succession, and from time to time the
faintly stirring breeze wafted their fragrance to us.

<Sent id="5074">
Text = The never ceasing
concert of those who "sow not, neither do they reap" and are free as the
air they cleave with their sportive wings was all about us.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5075">
Text = It seemed as
though at that moment every flower, every blade of grass was exhaling
the aroma of sacrifice, was saying to its Creator, "Father, I am blessed
and happy."
</Sent>
<Sent id="5076">
Text = I glanced at the poor woman, who alone was like one dead amidst all this
joyous life; two big tears hung motionless on her lashes, wrung from her
heart by bitter grief.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5077">
Text = It was in my power to relieve and console this
poor, fainting heart, only I did not know how to approach the subject,
how to take the first step.

<Sent id="5078">

</Sent>
<Sent id="5079">
Text = A hundred times I was on
the point of going up to her, but every time my face glowed like fire.

<Sent id="5080">
Text = Suddenly a bright idea dawned upon me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5081">
Text = I had found a way of doing it;
</Sent>
<Sent id="5082">
Text = I
revived.

"Would you like me to pick you a nosegay?" I said, in such a joyful
voice that Mme M. immediately raised her head and looked at me intently.

"Yes, do," she said at last in a weak voice, with a faint smile, at once
dropping her eyes on the book again.

"Or soon they will be mowing the grass here and there will be no
flowers," I cried, eagerly setting to work.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5083">
Text = I had soon picked my nosegay, a poor, simple one, I should have been
ashamed to take it indoors; but how light my heart was as I picked the
flowers and tied them up!
</Sent>
<Sent id="5084">
Text = The dog-rose and the wild jasmine I picked
closer to the seat, I knew that not far off there was a field of rye,
not yet ripe.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5085">
Text = I ran there for cornflowers;
</Sent>
<Sent id="5086">
Text = I mixed them with tall ears
of rye, picking out the finest and most golden.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5087">
Text = Close by I came upon a
perfect nest of forget-me-nots, and my nosegay was almost complete.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5088">
Text = Farther away in the meadow there were dark-blue campanulas and wild
pinks, and I ran down to the very edge of the river to get yellow
water-lilies.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5089">
Text = At last, making my way back, and going for an instant into
the wood to get some bright green fan-shaped leaves of the maple to put
round the nosegay, I happened to come across a whole family of pansies,
close to which, luckily for me, the fragrant scent of violets betrayed
the little flower hiding in the thick lush grass and still glistening
with drops of dew.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5090">
Text = The nosegay was complete.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5091">
Text = I bound it round with fine
long grass which twisted into a rope, and I carefully lay the letter in
the centre, hiding it with the flowers, but in such a way that it could
be very easily noticed if the slightest attention were bestowed upon my
nosegay.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5092">
Text = I carried it to Mme.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5093">
Text = M.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5094">
Text = On the way it seemed to me that the letter was lying too much in view: I
hid it a little more.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5095">
Text = As I got nearer I thrust it still further in the
flowers; and finally, when I was on the spot, I suddenly poked it so
deeply into the centre of the nosegay that it could not be noticed at
all from outside.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5096">
Text = My cheeks were positively flaming.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5097">
Text = I wanted to hide my
face in my hands and run away at once, but she glanced at my flowers as
though she had completely forgotten that I had gathered them.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5098">
Text = Mechanically, almost without looking, she held out her hand and took my
present; but at once laid it on the seat as though I had handed it to
her for that purpose and dropped her eyes to her book again, seeming
lost in thought.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5099">
Text = I was ready to cry at this mischance. "If only my
nosegay were close to her," I thought; "if only she had not forgotten
it!" I lay down on the grass not far off, put my right arm under my
head, and closed my eyes as though I were overcome by drowsiness.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5100">
Text = But I
waited, keeping my eyes fixed on her.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5101">
Text = Ten minutes passed, it seemed to me that she was getting paler and paler
... fortunately a blessed chance came to my aid.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5102">
Text = This was a big, golden bee, brought by a kindly breeze, luckily for me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5103">
Text = It first buzzed over my head, and then flew up to Mme.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5104">
Text = M. She waved it
off once or twice, but the bee grew more and more persistent.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5105">
Text = At last
Mme.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5106">
Text = M. snatched up my nosegay and waved it before my face.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5107">
Text = At that
instant the letter dropped out from among the flowers and fell straight
upon the open book.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5108">
Text = I started.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5109">
Text = For some time Mme.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5110">
Text = M., mute with
amazement, stared first at the letter and then at the flowers which she
was holding in her hands, and she seemed unable to believe her eyes.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5111">
Text = All
at once she flushed, started, and glanced at me.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5112">
Text = But I caught her
movement and I shut my eyes tight, pretending to be asleep.

<Sent id="5113">
Text = Nothing
would have induced me to look her straight in the face at that moment.

<Sent id="5114">
Text = My heart was throbbing and leaping like a bird in the grasp of some
village boy.

three minutes.

<Sent id="5117">
Text = Mme.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5118">
Text = M. was greedily
reading the letter, and from her glowing cheeks, her sparkling, tearful
eyes, her bright face, every feature of which was quivering with joyful
emotion, I guessed that there was happiness in the letter and all her
misery was dispersed like smoke.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5119">
Text = An agonizing, sweet feeling gnawed at
my heart, it was hard for me to go on pretending....
</Sent>
<Sent id="5120">

"Mme.

me and bent over me.

<Sent id="5128">
Text = My eyelashes quivered, but I controlled myself and did not open my eyes.

<Sent id="5129">
Text = I tried to breathe more evenly and quietly, but my heart smothered me
with its violent throbbing.

<Sent id="5130">
Text = Her burning breath scorched my cheeks; she
bent close down to my face as though trying to make sure.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5131">
Text = At last a kiss
and tears fell on my hand, the one which was lying on my breast.

"Natalie!

<Sent id="5132">
Text = Natalie! where are you," we heard again, this time quite
close.

"Coming," said Mme.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5133">
Text = M., in her mellow, silvery voice, which was so
choked and quivering with tears and so subdued that no one but I could
hear that, "Coming!"
</Sent>
<Sent id="5134">
Text = But at that instant my heart at last betrayed me and seemed to send all
my blood rushing to my face.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5135">
Text = At that instant a swift, burning kiss
scalded my lips.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5136">
Text = I uttered a faint cry.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5137">
Text = I opened my eyes, but at once
the same gauze kerchief fell upon them, as though she meant to screen me
from the sun.

<Sent id="5138">
Text = An instant later she was gone.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5139">
Text = I heard nothing but the
sound of rapidly retreating steps.

some moments I was almost frantic....

Text = Hardly able to breathe, leaning on
my elbow on the grass, I stared unconsciously before me at the
surrounding slopes, streaked with cornfields, at the river that flowed
twisting and winding far away, as far as the eye could see, between
fresh hills and villages that gleamed like dots all over the sunlit
distance--at the dark-blue, hardly visible forests, which seemed as
though smoking at the edge of the burning sky, and a sweet stillness
inspired by the triumphant peacefulness of the picture gradually brought
calm to my troubled heart.

<Sent id="5143">
Text = I felt more at ease and breathed more freely,
but my whole soul was full of a dumb, sweet yearning, as though a veil
had been drawn from my eyes as though at a foretaste of something.

<Sent id="5144">
Text = My
frightened heart, faintly quivering with expectation, was groping
timidly and joyfully towards some conjecture ... and all at once my
bosom heaved, began aching as though something had pierced it, and
tears, sweet tears, gushed from my eyes.

<Sent id="5145">
Text = I hid my face in my hands, and
quivering like a blade of grass, gave myself up to the first
consciousness and revelation of my heart, the first vague glimpse of my
nature.

Text = A STORY
</Sent>
<Sent id="5153">
Text = In the darkest and humblest corner of Ustinya Fyodorovna's flat lived
Semyon Ivanovitch Prohartchin, a well-meaning elderly man, who did not
drink.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5154">
Text = Since Mr. Prohartchin was of a very humble grade in the service,
and received a salary strictly proportionate to his official capacity,
Ustinya Fyodorovna could not get more than five roubles a month from him
for his lodging.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5155">
Text = Some people said that she had her own reasons for
accepting him as a lodger; but, be that as it may, as though in despite
of all his detractors, Mr. Prohartchin actually became her favourite, in
an honourable and virtuous sense, of course.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5156">
Text = It must be observed that
Ustinya Fyodorovna, a very respectable woman, who had a special
partiality for meat and coffee, and found it difficult to keep the
fasts, let rooms to several other boarders who paid twice as much as
Semyon Ivanovitch, yet not being quiet lodgers, but on the contrary all
of them "spiteful scoffers" at her feminine ways and her forlorn
helplessness, stood very low in her good opinion, so that if it had not
been for the rent they paid, she would not have cared to let them stay,
nor indeed to see them in her flat at all.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5157">
Text = Semyon Ivanovitch had become
her favourite from the day when a retired, or, perhaps more correctly
speaking, discharged clerk, with a weakness for strong drink, was
carried to his last resting-place in Volkovo.

<Sent id="5158">
Text = Though this gentleman had
only one eye, having had the other knocked out owing, in his own words,
to his valiant behaviour; and only one leg, the other having been broken
in the same way owing to his valour; yet he had succeeded in winning all
the kindly feeling of which Ustinya Fyodorovna was capable, and took the
fullest advantage of it, and would probably have gone on for years
living as her devoted satellite and toady if he had not finally drunk
himself to death in the most pitiable way.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5159">
Text = All this had happened at
Peski, where Ustinya Fyodorovna only had three lodgers, of whom, when
she moved into a new flat and set up on a larger scale, letting to about
a dozen new boarders, Mr. Prohartchin was the only one who remained.
</Sent>
<Sent id="5160">
Text = Whether Mr. Prohartchin had certain incorrigible defects, or whether his
companions were, every one of them, to blame, there seemed to be
misunderstandings on both sides from the first.

<Sent id="5161">
Text = We must observe here
that all Ustinya Fyodorovna's new lodgers without exception got on
together like brothers; some of them were in the same office; each one
of them by turns lost all his money to the others at faro, preference
and _bixe_; they all liked in a merry hour to enjoy what they called the
fizzing moments of life in a crowd together; they were fond, too, at
times of discussing lofty subjects, and though in the end things rarely
passed off without a dispute, yet as all prejudices were banished from
the whole party the general harmony was not in the least disturbed
thereby.

something from their salary, and with the sum so obtained, to hire a

gentlemanliness and good-breeding, courtesy, respect for their seniors,
strength of will, a good and grateful heart and various agreeable

of his salary had been deducted, that now he had nothing left to send
his sister-in-law; then to speak with commiseration of his

there will be no porridge," he added grimly as he went down the stairs,

the little bald man, probably equally unconscious that he was acting as
a phantom and not as a substantial reality, held up his hand about
thirty inches from the floor, and waving it vertically, muttered that
the eldest was going to school, then glancing with indignation at Semyon
Ivanovitch, as though it were Mr. Prohartchin's fault that he was the
father of seven, pulled his old hat down over his eyes, and with a whisk
